# QA Action Report: WordPress to Next.js Migration

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** Critical Issues Identified  
**Testing Environment:** Local (http://localhost:3000) vs Live (https://polything.co.uk)

## Executive Summary

The side-by-side QA testing has revealed **critical routing and content issues** that prevent the migrated site from functioning properly. While the homepage loads with different content, most other pages return 404 errors, indicating that the contentlayer integration and dynamic routing are not working correctly.

### Key Findings
- ✅ **Homepage**: Loads but with different content structure
- ❌ **Most Pages**: Return 404 errors (About, Contact, Services, Projects, Blog)
- ❌ **Contentlayer**: Not properly integrated for dynamic page generation
- ❌ **Routing**: Dynamic routes not functioning

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. Contentlayer Integration Failure
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete site functionality  
**Pages Affected:** All dynamic pages (About, Contact, Services, Projects, Blog)

**Problem:** The contentlayer integration is not working, causing all exported content to be inaccessible via dynamic routes.

**Evidence:**
- `/about` returns 404 instead of showing About page content
- `/contact` returns 404 instead of showing Contact page content  
- `/work/blackriver` returns 404 instead of showing project content
- `/blog` returns 404 instead of showing blog index

**Required Actions:**
1. **Fix Contentlayer Configuration**: Review and fix `contentlayer.config.ts`
2. **Enable Dynamic Routes**: Ensure `app/[slug]/page.tsx` and other dynamic routes are working
3. **Verify Content Export**: Confirm all 77 exported content items are properly accessible
4. **Test Contentlayer Build**: Ensure contentlayer generates pages correctly during build

### 2. Homepage Content Mismatch
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Brand consistency and user experience  
**Pages Affected:** Homepage only

**Problem:** The homepage loads but shows different content than the live WordPress site.

**Evidence:**
- **Title**: "Polything | Strategic Marketing for Visionary Brands" vs "Polything Marketing Consultancy - Based in London"
- **H1**: "Build a Brand That Leads — Without the Guesswork" vs "ELEVATE YOUR MARKETING"
- **Images**: 14 vs 64 images (significant content missing)
- **Links**: 11 vs 57 links (navigation and content links missing)

**Required Actions:**
1. **Content Audit**: Compare homepage content between local and live versions
2. **Hero Section**: Ensure hero component displays correct title and subtitle
3. **Navigation**: Verify all navigation links are present and functional
4. **Content Sections**: Ensure all homepage sections are properly rendered

## High Priority Issues

### 3. Navigation Structure Mismatch
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** User experience and site navigation  
**Pages Affected:** All pages

**Problem:** Navigation structure differs between local and live versions.

**Evidence:**
- Local site shows different navigation elements
- Missing navigation components on most pages
- Button counts don't match between versions

**Required Actions:**
1. **Navigation Component**: Review and fix navigation component implementation
2. **Responsive Navigation**: Ensure mobile and desktop navigation work correctly
3. **Active States**: Verify navigation active states and highlighting

### 4. Meta Data Inconsistencies
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** SEO and social sharing  
**Pages Affected:** All pages

**Problem:** Meta descriptions and other SEO elements don't match between versions.

**Evidence:**
- Meta descriptions differ between local and live versions
- Title tags show different content
- Missing or incorrect structured data

**Required Actions:**
1. **SEO Metadata**: Review metadata generation in layout components
2. **Meta Descriptions**: Ensure proper meta description fallbacks
3. **Structured Data**: Verify JSON-LD implementation

## Medium Priority Issues

### 5. Image and Link Count Discrepancies
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Content completeness  
**Pages Affected:** All pages

**Problem:** Significant differences in image and link counts between versions.

**Evidence:**
- Homepage: 14 vs 64 images, 11 vs 57 links
- Other pages: 0 vs multiple images/links (due to 404 errors)

**Required Actions:**
1. **Image Migration**: Verify all images are properly migrated and accessible
2. **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal and external links work correctly
3. **Content Completeness**: Verify no content is missing from migration

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue appears to be that **contentlayer is not properly integrated** with the Next.js application. This is evidenced by:

1. **404 Errors**: All dynamic routes return 404, indicating contentlayer isn't generating pages
2. **Build Issues**: The task list mentions contentlayer was "temporarily disabled due to import issues"
3. **Content Inaccessibility**: 77 exported content items are not accessible via the application

### Immediate Technical Actions Required

1. **Restore Contentlayer Integration**
   ```bash
   # Check contentlayer configuration
   cat contentlayer.config.ts
   
   # Verify content directory structure
   ls -la content/
   
   # Test contentlayer build
   npx contentlayer build
   ```

2. **Fix Dynamic Route Implementation**
   - Review `app/[slug]/page.tsx`
   - Review `app/work/[slug]/page.tsx` 
   - Review `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`

3. **Verify Content Export**
   - Check that all 77 content items are in `/content/` directory
   - Verify MDX files have proper front-matter
   - Test contentlayer document types

## Recommended Fix Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. **Fix Contentlayer Integration** - Enable dynamic page generation
2. **Restore Dynamic Routes** - Ensure all exported content is accessible
3. **Test Core Pages** - Verify About, Contact, Services, Projects, Blog work

## Testing Recommendations

### After Fixes Are Applied
1. **Re-run QA Script**: Execute the same QA testing script to verify fixes
2. **Manual Testing**: Test each page manually to ensure functionality
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify page load times and Core Web Vitals
