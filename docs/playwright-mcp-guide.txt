Using just a prompt file inside VS Code, I asked the MCP server to:
✅ Navigate to my personal site
✅ Locate the podcast page
✅ Interact with podcast filters
✅ Automatically generate a test report based on what it saw
✅ Produce a test plan in plain English with expected outcomes
✅ Then run the test plan to verify everything worked as expected
