3. **Navigation Issues:** Structure differs between versions
4. **SEO Problems:** Meta data inconsistencies

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing Approach
1. **Browser Automation:** Playwright with Chromium
2. **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Local vs Live versions
3. **Content Extraction:** DOM analysis and comparison
4. **Screenshot Capture:** Visual comparison evidence
5. **Issue Categorization:** Critical, High, Medium priority

### Testing Coverage
- **Visual Comparison:** Screenshots of both versions
- **Content Analysis:** Title, meta, headings, images, links
- **Functional Testing:** Navigation, buttons, forms
- **Performance Monitoring:** Page load times and errors

## Deliverables

### 1. QA Checklist (`docs/qa-checklist.md`)
Comprehensive testing checklist covering:
- Core navigation pages
- Project/case study pages
- Blog posts and static pages
- Technical validation (SEO, performance, accessibility)
- Cross-browser and mobile testing

### 2. QA Testing Script (`scripts/qa-side-by-side.js`)
Reusable automation script with:
- Configurable page list
- Automated screenshot capture
- Content comparison logic
- Issue detection and reporting
- JSON and Markdown report generation

### 3. QA Reports
- **Technical Report:** Detailed JSON data for developers
- **Summary Report:** Human-readable markdown for stakeholders
- **Action Report:** Prioritized tasks for fixing issues

### 4. Screenshots
Visual evidence captured in `test-results/qa-comparison/`:
- Local version screenshots
- Live version screenshots
- Side-by-side comparison capability

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Contentlayer Integration** - Critical for site functionality
2. **Restore Dynamic Routing** - Enable access to exported content
3. **Align Homepage Content** - Ensure brand consistency

### Process Improvements
1. **Re-run QA After Fixes** - Use the same script to verify improvements
2. **Expand Page Coverage** - Test additional pages as they become available
3. **Add Performance Testing** - Include Core Web Vitals measurement
4. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Test in multiple browsers

### Future QA Process
1. **Automated Regression Testing** - Run QA script after each deployment
2. **Continuous Monitoring** - Set up automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Performance Benchmarking** - Track performance metrics over time

## Success Metrics

### Testing Coverage
- ✅ **Pages Tested:** 10/10 planned pages
- ✅ **Issues Identified:** 10/10 pages with documented issues
- ✅ **Reports Generated:** 3 comprehensive reports
- ✅ **Screenshots Captured:** 20 screenshots (local + live for each page)

### Process Efficiency
- ✅ **Automation:** 100% automated testing process
- ✅ **Reproducibility:** Script can be re-run anytime
- ✅ **Documentation:** Complete audit trail of findings
- ✅ **Actionability:** Clear next steps identified

## Conclusion

The QA process successfully identified critical issues preventing the migrated site from functioning properly. The primary issue is the contentlayer integration failure, which must be addressed immediately. Once fixed, the same QA process can be used to verify the improvements and ensure the migration meets the PRD requirements.

The automated testing approach provides a solid foundation for ongoing quality assurance and can be easily extended to cover additional pages and testing scenarios as the migration progresses.
