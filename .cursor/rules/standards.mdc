# Rule: General Coding and Project Standards

- **Design System First:** Always use components, styles, and tokens from the `/design-system` documentation. Propose new components before implementing them.
- **Conventional Commits:** All git commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`).
- **Language Standards:**
  - **Python:** Adhere to PEP 8 for styling. Use type hints for all function signatures.
  - **TypeScript/TSX:** Adhere to the rules configured in our ESLint and Prettier setup.
- **Clarity:** Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and files. Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
