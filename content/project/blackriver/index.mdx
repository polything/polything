<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true"></div> <h4>Blackriver Ramps faced a significant challenge with their annual Black Friday campaign.</h4> <div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true"></div> <div style="grid-template-columns:auto 53%"><div> <h2>Background</h2> <p>Despite the day&#8217;s potential for high sales volume, past efforts had not achieved the desired impact in terms of return on ad spend (ROAS) and overall engagement. The campaigns lacked the strategic differentiation and innovation needed to stand out in the highly competitive Black Friday environment.</p> <p>In response to these challenges, Blackriver Ramps engaged Polything with a specific goal: to reinvigorate their Black Friday strategy and improve performance metrics. </p> <p>This case study outlines our approach to restructuring their campaign, focusing on targeted strategies, audience engagement, and dynamic advertising solutions. It highlights the process from initial analysis and strategy development through to implementation and results evaluation.</p> <p>Our collaboration aimed to not only enhance Blackriver Ramps&#8217; Black Friday campaign results but also to set a new standard for their future digital marketing efforts. Here&#8217;s a comprehensive overview of the steps taken and the outcomes achieved, reflecting Polything&#8217;s commitment to delivering measurable success through tailored marketing strategies.</p> </div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/1581-blackriver-0522-lichtzelt_com-1024x683.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/1581-blackriver-0522-lichtzelt_com-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/1581-blackriver-0522-lichtzelt_com-300x200.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/1581-blackriver-0522-lichtzelt_com-768x512.jpg 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/1581-blackriver-0522-lichtzelt_com.jpg 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div> <div style="grid-template-columns:47% auto"><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/0322-blackriver-0921-1024x683.jpg" alt="" title="" srcset="https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/0322-blackriver-0921-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/0322-blackriver-0921-300x200.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/0322-blackriver-0921-768x512.jpg 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/0322-blackriver-0921-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/0322-blackriver-0921-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div> <h2>The Challenge</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Past Performance</strong>: Previous Black Friday campaigns by Blackriver Ramps resulted in modest ROAS, failing to capitalize on the significant sales potential of the event.</li> <li><strong>Engagement Issues</strong>: The campaigns struggled to effectively engage their core demographic of 13-27-year-old skateboarding enthusiasts, leading to low conversion rates.</li> <li><strong>Market Differentiation</strong>: Amidst the saturated market of Black Friday deals, Blackriver Ramps&#8217; offers were not sufficiently differentiated, blending into the vast array of promotions.</li> </ul> </div></div> <div style="grid-template-columns:auto 53%"><div> <h2><strong>Strategic Solution</strong></h2> <ul> <li><strong>Prospecting </strong>&#8211; Identified and targeted potential new customers with interests aligned with skateboarding and fingerboarding culture.</li> <li><strong>Re-engagement</strong> &#8211; Reconnected with past visitors to reignite their interest using personalised messages.</li> <li><strong>Retargeting and Retention</strong> &#8211; Focused on individuals who had shown interest but did not purchase and rewarded loyal customers with exclusive deals.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Organic and Paid Synergies </strong>&#8211; Increased organic activity weeks before Black Friday to build anticipation.
