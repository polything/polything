While some things may stay the same, such as providing valuable content and <a href="https://polything.co.uk/" >building an audience</a>, there are other factors you&#8217;ll need to take into account to make your blog stand out. In this post, we&#8217;ll outline what those factors are and how you can make sure your blog is successful.</p> <p id="364c9f57-9146-458c-8f19-c40527160d55">There are a few key changes that have taken place since 2020 that bloggers need to take into account. First, the way people consume content has changed. People are now more likely to consume content on their <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/statistics/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile devices than on desktop</a> computers. This means that your blog needs to be optimized for mobile devices. Additionally, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/organic-reach-declining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media platforms have changed</a> the way they operate, which has impacted bloggers who use those platforms to promote their content. Finally, Google&#8217;s algorithms have changed, which means that your blog needs to be more SEO-friendly than ever before.</p> <h2>Choose a topic for your blog and stick with it</h2> <p id="5141090c-8bdd-4deb-9891-befe4300a274">When it comes to blogging, one of the most important things you can do is choose a topic and stick with it. By focusing on a specific topic, you&#8217;ll be able to provide your readers with valuable content that they can&#8217;t find elsewhere. Additionally, by sticking with a specific topic, you&#8217;ll be able to build an audience who is interested in what you have to say.</p> <h2>Ensure your blogging platform or CMS is fast and mobile-friendly</h2> <p id="64ce2925-5bcb-4507-87be-03272d74f8cd">Blogging platforms come in all shapes and sizes, but the most important thing for a blogger is that the platform is fast and mobile-friendly. This is because more and more people are reading blogs on their mobile devices, so you want your blog to be easy to read on any device. If you are using a CMS or blogging platform that is not mobile-friendly, you are likely to lose readers.</p> <h2>Join the online community in your topic area</h2> <p id="64ce2925-5bcb-4507-87be-03272d74f8cd">It’s important to join and engage with the online community on your topic because it will help you get exposure for your blog. When you engage with other people on your topic, they will see your blog and, if they like what they see, they may start following your blog and sharing your content.</p> <h2>Use outreach</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">Outreach is a great way to promote your blog and get it seen by new readers. When you undertake outreach, you send emails or DMs to influencers and other bloggers in your niche and ask them to share your blog with their audience. This is a great way to get your blog seen by a new audience and get some exposure.</p> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">If you can get an influencer to share your blog with their audience, you will get a lot of exposure. One way to get an influencer to share your blog is to guest post on their blog. This will help you get your name out there and get your blog seen by a new audience.</p> <h2>Grow your email list</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">Growing your email list is important because it will help you get more exposure for your blog. When you have a list of email subscribers, you can send them updates about your latest blog posts and they will be more likely to visit your blog and share it with their friends.</p> <p id="9c0f6b62-60a8-4987-8aeb-c4f1b2d55d1f">There are a lot of different ways to grow your email list, but one of the best ways is to create a hook. A hook is something that will get people interested in subscribing to your email list. For example, you could offer a free ebook or report when people subscribe to your email list.</p> <h2>Leverage social media</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">When it comes to promoting your blog, social media is still one of the best tools at your disposal. Not only is it a great way to get your blog seen by a lot of people, but it’s also a great way to get exposure for your content.</p> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">One of the best ways to use social media for promoting your blog is to engage with influencers in your topic area. When you engage with influencers, users will see your blog and, if they like what they see, they may start following your blog and sharing your content.</p> <h2>Make sure your content is SEO-friendly</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">One of the best ways to get your blog seen is to make sure your content is SEO-friendly. This means creating content that is keyword rich and optimized for the search engines. When you create <a href="https://polything.co.uk/services/" >SEO-friendly content</a>, you are more likely to get found by readers who are searching for information on the web.</p> <h2>Work on getting referral traffic</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">Referral traffic is the traffic that comes to your blog from other websites. This can be a great way to get your blog seen by new readers. One way to get referral traffic is to guest post on other blogs in your niche. When you guest post, you include a link back to your blog in your author bio. This will help readers find your blog and get exposure to your content.</p> <h2>Be consistent</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">One of the best ways to get your blog seen is to be consistent with your posting schedule. This means posting new content regularly. When you are consistent with your posting schedule, you are more likely to keep readers engaged and coming back for more. One way to make sure you are consistent with your posting schedule is to set up an email outreach schedule. This will help you keep track of your blog posts and make sure you are sending out new content on a regular frequency.</p> <h2>Write original content</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">When it comes to blogging, original content is key. If you constantly rehash the same topics, your readers will get bored and may stop visiting your blog. This is why it’s important to come up with fresh, new ideas for your content.</p> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">One way to come up with new ideas for your content is to get inspired by other bloggers in your niche. Take a look at what they are writing about and see if you can add your own spin to it. Another great way to come up with new ideas is to use social media. See what people are talking about in your niche and get inspired by their conversations.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p id="0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f">What makes a good blog in 2022?
