<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Search Console is Google&#8217;s free web-based service for website owners to monitor Google search results, Google Ads campaigns, and Google Analytics data. It allows you to see how your site appears in Google searches and if there are any errors on your pages preventing them from loading correctly. It also gives you the opportunity to submit a sitemap of all of your site content so that Google can crawl it more efficiently and index its pages faster. This article will give you some tips on how to set Google Search Console so that you can get the most out of this free tool!</p> <h2>Contents</h2> <ol> <li><a href="#getting-started" >How to set up Google search console</a></li> <li><a href="#Verify-ownership" >Verify site ownership</a></li> <li><a href="#index-and-crawl-errors" >Make sure Google can read your pages</a></li> <li><a href="#mobile-usability-errors" >Review mobile usability errors</a></li> <li><a href="http://Submitting-a-sitemap" >Submitting a sitemap </a></li> <li><a href="http://get-the-most-out-of-it" >How can you get the most out of it</a></li> <li><a href="#benefits" >The benefits of using this service</a></li> <li><a href="#tips" >Tips for getting your site verified </a></li> </ol> <figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Google-Search-Console-Guide-1024x682.jpg" alt="Google_Search_Console_Guide" title="" srcset="https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Google-Search-Console-Guide-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Google-Search-Console-Guide-300x200.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Google-Search-Console-Guide-768x512.jpg 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Google-Search-Console-Guide-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/Google-Search-Console-Guide.jpg 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure> <h2 id="getting-started"><strong>How to get started </strong>&#8211; setup Google search console</h2> <p>To create a Google search console account you&#8217;ll need a Gmail account or create one if you don&#8217;t already have one. Visit Google&#8217;s main search console page (<a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">search.google.com</a>) where you can sign into Google search console . Google will ask you to verify that you own the website associated with your Gmail account, so it&#8217;s important to make sure that the site is set up correctly before verifying your ownership of it (see step two).</p> <p>After signing in to your account for the first time you&#8217;ll be directed to the Google search console dashboard. At this point you will need to add a new property by following Google&#8217;s instructions. Google will ask you to include your site&#8217;s URL, choose the preferred domain if there are more than one associated with this property (for example, Google can crawl both &#8220;example.com&#8221; and &#8220;shop.example.com&#8221;), add a default description for your website, and enter an active status of either Active or Pending Review.</p> <h2 id="Verify-ownership"><strong><strong>Verify site ownership</strong></strong></h2> <p>Google will also provide you with a verification code that you&#8217;ll need to enter into your website&#8217;s HTML source code to finish verifying ownership of the site.</p> <p>After following the instructions to verify site ownership, Google can now crawl and index all of your pages as it sees fit. However, there are several things you&#8217;ll want to do to make Google&#8217;s job easier and to ensure that Google can properly crawl all of your site content.</p> <h2 id="index-and-crawl-errors"><strong><strong><strong>Make sure Google can read your pages</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>In order for it to see what kind of errors might be preventing Google from crawling and indexing the content on a website, you&#8217;ll want to check how Google crawls it by following these steps:</p> <p>&#8211; Google Search Console will provide you with a list of the pages that it has indexed. Click on &#8220;Fetch as Google&#8221; to get HTML code for one of your site&#8217;s URLs, which can be used in Google&#8217;s browser testing tool called Fetch as Google.</p> <p>&#8211; After pasting the URL into Google&#8217;s fetch tool and clicking on Google&#8217;s &#8220;Fetch and Render&#8221; button to submit the request, Google will respond with a list of errors that might be preventing Google from viewing your site correctly.</p> <p>&#8211; If you see anything in this list starting with the word &#8220;Blocked,&#8221; it means Google has stopped reading one or more pages on your website because they are returning an error. Google will only index the content on your site if it can read all of its pages, so you&#8217;ll want to fix any blocked errors that are preventing Google from seeing your website&#8217;s full content.</p> <h2 id="mobile-usability-errors"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Review mobile usability errors</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>Google also provides a list of mobile usability issues related to how Google views each page on your site for both Mobile Friendly and Mobile-First Indexing. Google provides specific information about each issue that includes the number of pages on your site Google has identified with this problem, their page titles and URLs, possible reasons why Google might be having problems crawling these pages (either because they are not mobile-friendly or Google can&#8217;t index them correctly), and what you&#8217;ll need to do to fix the issues Google finds.</p> <h2 id="Submitting-a-sitemap"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Submitting a sitemap to </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>To make sure Google can crawl and index all of your site&#8217;s pages, you will need to submit a Sitemap for your website using submit sitemap tab from the dashboard. This is an XML file that lists URLs on your site as well as metadata about those pages such as when Google last crawled them, how often they are updated, and what priority each URL has for Googlebot.</p> <p>Sitemap files can be submitted directly to the platform or via a Sitemap generator that creates the file for you based on your site&#8217;s existing content (such as URLs, metadata about those pages such as their frequency of updates, priority Google should give them, and whether Google has already indexed those pages or not).</p> <h2 id="get-the-most-out-of-it">How to use Google search console for SEO</h2> <p>After following these steps to set up Google Search Console for your site using either a Sitemap file generated by another tool or submitted manually within Google&#8217;s system, there are several things that you&#8217;ll want to do within the platform on a regular basis.</p> <p>&#8211; Review your Google Search Analytics data regularly so you can see how much traffic Google is sending your way from its search results and which keywords are currently bringing the most visitors to your site, for example.</p> <p>&#8211; Check Google&#8217;s indexing status of each page on your website by clicking into Google&#8217;s indexing report for your site. Google will flag any pages that Google isn&#8217;t currently able to find or access, so you can check what is preventing Google from crawling and indexing them.</p> <p>&#8211; Use Google Search Console&#8217;s new Fetch as Google tool on a regular basis to see how Google views each page of your website in its own browser. Google will highlight any errors Google finds on your pages and you can use this information to fix those issues so Google can index them correctly.</p> <p>&#8211; Monitor the number of security incidents by clicking into Google&#8217;s Security Issues reports within the platform. If there are high numbers here, it might be because hackers have found a vulnerability in one or more pages on your website. Google will provide specific information about which pages Google has identified with these types of issues and what you can do to fix them quickly.</p> <p>&#8211; Use Google Search Console&#8217;s new Index Coverage report in the Crawl section to see how well Google is able to access all of your site&#8217;s pages at present, how many are still being blocked by Google, and whether Google is receiving any errors when accessing those pages.</p> <p>&#8211; Make sure Google can access your website using its IP address (instead of typing in the domain name) to verify that you have set up crawling for your site correctly. If Google only returns an error instead of seeing all of your site&#8217;s content with this method, Google might be having problems finding the right DNS records for your website. Google provides a specific message telling you what to do if Google can&#8217;t access your site&#8217;s pages with this method so that Google is able to crawl and index them correctly in future.</p> <p>&#8211; Check Google Search Console&#8217;s Index Status report within the Crawl section regularly for any issues Google has identified with Googlebot&#8217;s ability to access your site. Google can&#8217;t return any pages it isn&#8217;t able to crawl, so Google will highlight issues in this report when Google is unable to see all of your website content</p> <h2 id="benefits"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>The benefits of using this service</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>Google Search Console provides several key benefits that marketers should take advantage of if they are looking to have Google index and rank their site&#8217;s pages properly.</p> <p>&#8211; It is the only way for marketers to know what Googlebot sees on a daily basis, how Google ranks each page of a website by analyzing keywords on those pages, and where Google currently indexes all of your site&#8217;s content from within one central location instead of going into individual Google Analytics profiles.</p> <p>&#8211; It provides marketers with all of Google&#8217;s best practices for SEO, which they can follow to make sure Google crawls and indexes their content more effectively. They will know what Google expects from them in order to get the most out of this service based on how Google ranks websites itself.</p> <p>&#8211; Submitting a sitemap to Google Search Console ensures that Google knows where all of your site&#8217;s pages are and can access them properly. This is especially important for local businesses with a lot of locally targeted content since Google will be able to index these URLs more effectively when it has this information about each page available in the platform.</p> <p>&#8211; Using Google Search Console&#8217;s new mobile usability reports allows marketers to check Google&#8217;s crawling and indexing of their site&#8217;s pages for issues that Google has identified as affecting the user experience on mobile devices. This will allow them to fix these problems so Google can follow Google best practices for SEO by making sure it crawls, indexes, and ranks all of your website content correctly based on Google search engine ranking factors.</p> <p>&#8211; It is the easiest way to submit and monitor your site&#8217;s sitemap for Google, so marketers can make sure Google crawls all of their website content quickly, returns accurate results when users search for keywords on these pages in Google and index them properly based on how well they fit into Google search engine ranking factors.</p> <p>&#8211; It provides marketers with the opportunity to see Google&#8217;s indexing of their website content from within Google Analytics, which can be helpful for identifying major issues that might need to be fixed immediately so Google crawls and indexes all of your site&#8217;s pages correctly in future updates.</p> <h2 id="tips"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Tips for getting your site verified by Google search console</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>&#8211; Google Search Console provides a specific message telling you what to do if Google can&#8217;t access your site&#8217;s pages with this method so that Google is able to crawl and index them correctly in future. Google will tell users how they should be setting up their websites, which could help marketers get the most out of this service by following Google&#8217;s best practices for SEO.</p> <p>&#8211; Google Search Console provides marketers with all of Google&#8217;s best practices for SEO, which they can follow to make sure Google crawls and indexes their content more effectively.
