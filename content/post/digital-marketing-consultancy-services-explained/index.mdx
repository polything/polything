Within the top 10 agencies, the average billing currently stands at £138m, which is over 12 times the turnover of all the other players in the industry (Source: Statista &#8211; &#8220;<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4019/digital-marketing-in-the-uk/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital marketing in the United Kingdom</a>&#8220;).</p> <p id="2d735ce3-a70d-4f9d-8ab8-e7194584b091">But what if your company&#8217;s budgets are not big enough to attract one of the big 10 agencies?
