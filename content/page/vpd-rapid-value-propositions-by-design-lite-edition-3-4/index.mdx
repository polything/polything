<h3>Welcome to Your <strong>CVC + PVC Insight Engine</strong></h3> <p>This page is the quiet control room where your two interview transcripts meet a pair of specialist AI analysts. While they cross-match customer pains with product gains and surface any gaps, you can simply keep the tab open—then collect a crisp, merged brief the moment the run completes.</p> <p><em>(One-stop page for the two “deep-dive” analysis runs)</em></p> <hr /> <!--more--> <h3>What happens on this page — in plain English</h3> <ol> <li><strong>We ingest your interview transcripts</strong><br>The raw audio + confirmed summaries from the CVC and PVC calls are pushed into a secure analysis thread that only you and our system can see.
