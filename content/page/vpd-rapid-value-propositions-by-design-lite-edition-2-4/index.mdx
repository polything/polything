<p>Welcome to Your <strong>Product Value Canvas (PVC)</strong> Session</p> <p>You’ve already mapped your customer’s world in the CVC interview; now we’ll zero-in on what your <strong>product or service must deliver to create real, “can’t-live-without-it” value</strong>. In the next conversation, you’ll speak with our <strong>PVC Interviewer</strong> (also voice-enabled via ElevenLabs) while the on-page chatbot organises every insight in the background. When we’re done, you’ll have a crystal-clear list of <strong>Features, Pain-Relievers, and Gain-Creators</strong> ready for the Fit Workshop.</p> <hr />  <h3>Meet Your PVC Interviewer</h3> <p>Picture a <strong>product strategist with the bedside manner of a coach</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Starts by anchoring to the pains and gains you surfaced in the CVC.</li> <li>Digs for the functional facts — features, workflows, proof-points.</li> <li>Probes the “so-what?” layer: <em>How does this remove a pain? How could it delight?</em></li> <li>Summarises each block (Features ▸ Pain-Relievers ▸ Gain-Creators) so you can confirm or refine on the spot.</li> </ul> <hr /> <h3>Quick Prep &#8211; 5 Minutes Tops</h3> <p>Have these notes (or rough thoughts) within reach:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Top 5 product features</strong> your buyers rave about.</li> <li><strong>Proof of impact</strong>: metrics, case-study wins, testimonials.</li> <li><strong>Secret sauce / differentiators</strong> you’re proud of.</li> <li>Known <strong>constraints</strong> (lead-times, integrations, pricing quirks).</li> <li>Any <strong>future features</strong> you’re considering.</li> </ol> <p>Don’t sweat perfect wording; raw bullets are fine — the interviewer turns them into structured canvas blocks.</p> <hr /> <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3> <figure><table><thead><tr><th>Step</th><th>What happens</th><th>Your role</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1.
