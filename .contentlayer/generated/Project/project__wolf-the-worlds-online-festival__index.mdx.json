This included market sizing exercises, business modelling and customer journey mapping. The result was a fifty-point marketing programme delivered over the next 12-18 months to create a cut-through for the rebrand. After assessing resourcing, we formed a consensus that the in-house teams could not deliver the plan alone.</p> <p>WOLF appointed Polything to deliver ongoing strategy, programme management on the project, campaign activation and creative production. We operated as an extension of the in-house team, managing other suppliers and projects, managing the programme and upskilling in-house teams. Also, part of the remit was also to develop the high-level rebrand pack and bring the brand alive across social, corporate site, websites and in-app.</p> </div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/4-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/4-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/4-300x300.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/4-150x150.jpg 150w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/4-768x768.jpg 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/4.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /></figure></div> <div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div> <h2>The Scope</h2> <p>As part of the engagement, we provided training and coaching for WOLF’s in-house teams as well as developing SOPs and processes for them to deliver elements of the marketing programme.</p> <p>Polything worked with the in-house team to <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">develop clear segmentation, messaging and brand proposition based on user insights</a> and delivered acquisition campaigns until the in-house team gained enough confidence to take over campaign management.</p> <ul> <li>We developed an RFP for WOLF’s first corporate site, and selected appropriate vendors to work with.
