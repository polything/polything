But there are still many myths and misconceptions about them.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">People often think that they are expensive and only for businesses with a lot of money to spend. But that&#8217;s not always the case.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/fractional-marketing-expert-uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fractional marketing experts can benefit businesses</a> of all sizes and budgets to get the most out of their marketing efforts. So let&#8217;s debunk some of these myths and set the record straight.</p> <h2>Myths and Reality</h2> <h3>Myth 1: Fractional directors are only for big businesses with deep pockets</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/why-a-fractional-marketing-director/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fractional marketing directors</a> can help businesses of all sizes get the most out of their marketing budget. Whether you have a large budget or a small one, a fractional marketing expert can help you create a strategic plan that fits your needs and gets the most bang for your buck.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">Many will have worked at or with startups and will have experience in intensively bootstrapping a business to profitability and scale.</p> <h3>Myth 2: Fractional marketing experts are too expensive</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> The <a href=\"https://authenticbrand.com/fractional-cmo/fractional-cmo-cost/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cost of a fractional marketing expert</a> is often less than the cost of hiring a full-time employee. When you hire a fractional marketing expert, you only pay for the time and expertise that you need. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">The added benefit is that you will have a senior leader in your business who will be able to define <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">marketing strategy</a> and ensure you have the best product-market fit.</p> <h3>Myth 3: Fractional marketing experts are a luxury</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality</strong>: Fractional marketing experts can save you money. By helping you create a plan and execute it efficiently, a fractional marketing expert can help you avoid costly mistakes.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">They are acutely aware of their billing rates, and a good practitioner will almost always ensure that they have saved your business more than they have cost. Alternatively made you a positive return on investment in terms of additional sales.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">In fact, not having a senior marketing leader in your business could cost you money in the long run, through missed opportunities, lack of direction, and lack of accountability in your marketing function.</p> <h3>Myth 4: Fractional marketing experts won&#8217;t understand my business</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> Fractional marketing experts are experienced professionals who have worked with businesses of all sizes and industries.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">They understand the challenges that businesses face and actually, as part of their engagement they will want to <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2015/10/14/how-to-scan-through-your-environments-disruptive-threats-and-opportunities\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analyse your marketplace and competition</a>. In this capacity, their distance from the day-to-day of your business is an advantage and will yield better opportunity insights.</p> <h3>Myth 5: We can undertake digital transformation ourselves</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> With their extensive experience, they can help you navigate the digital landscape and find the right tools and strategies for your business. Digital transformation is a complex process, and it&#8217;s constantly changing. A fractional marketing expert can save you time and money by avoiding the pitfalls that less experienced marketers might make.</p> <h3>Myth 6: Without a formal full-time role fractional marketing experts are unable to affect change.</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> Fractional marketing experts are change agents. Unlike consultants, who simply offer advice, fractional marketing experts roll up their sleeves and help you implement the changes that they recommend.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">This hands-on approach ensures that the changes are made efficiently and effectively. Also not being engaged in your business permanently full-time means that they can push changes that are unpopular but are in the best interests of your business.</p> <h3>Myth 7: Fractional marketing experts can only help if we have a marketing-related issue.</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> This is a moot point, but most experts will have had the experience of managing multi-disciplined teams across, technical, product, development, operations, and even customer service.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">They often become the CEO’s right-hand person, managing strategic and operational issues as they relate to marketing. This provides an invaluable outside perspective that can help businesses of all sizes solve problems and achieve their goals.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">Fractional marketing experts are a great choice for businesses of all sizes and budgets. If you&#8217;re looking to get the most out of your marketing efforts, don&#8217;t let myths hold you back.</p> <h3>About the author</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">Chris Talintyre is a fractional marketing expert with over 10 years of experience helping businesses grow.
