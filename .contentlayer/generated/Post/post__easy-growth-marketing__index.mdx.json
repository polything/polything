It can involve many different strategies, including social media marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, and email marketing.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">There are many reasons why you should care about easy growth marketing. First and foremost, it's an incredibly effective way to reach new customers and grow your business. It's also a great way to build brand awareness, affinity, and loyalty. Who doesn't want more people talking about your company?</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Finally, it can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional forms of marketing, which can be expensive and time-consuming. You could go and hire a growth hacker company, but approaching this yourself will pay dividends in the long run.</p> <h2 id=\"basics\">The basics of easy growth marketing</h2> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">There are a few things you should know before you get started with easy growth marketing. First, it's important to <a href=\"https://colemaninsights.com/coleman-insights-blog/start-with-the-customer-and-work-backwards#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">understand your target market</a> and what kinds of strategies are likely to appeal to them. Second, you'll need to adopt a growth-hacking mindset and be prepared to accept 'done' over 'perfect'. You'll need to set some goals for your growth marketing campaigns and determine how you'll measure success. Finally, it's helpful to have a budget in mind, so that you can invest in the right tools and resources.</p> <h2 id=\"8\">8 easy ways to dip your toe into growth marketing</h2> <h3>1. Set up social media profiles.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Creating social media accounts is a quick and easy way to get started with growth marketing. Even if you're not ready to start using them yet, it's good to have them set up so you're ready to go for when you are. Also by taking the time to set them up you will <a href=\"https://seattlewebsearch.com/2022/04/social-media-seo-how-social-signals-impact-search-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signal to search engines</a> that you are a reputable company and generate valuable links and citations for your business.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: When starting to test channels always test the channels and platforms that your existing customers are using first.</p> <h3>2. Set up an account with an ESP.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">If you're not already using an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-email-provider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email service provider</a>, now is the time to sign up for one. Having an ESP will allow you to have a way to directly communicate with potential customs and build trust with them. Owning your own consumer data is essential to building your email list and automating some of your marketing at a low cost.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Consider how many emails you might send upfront, also think about the functionality of a system that you will actually use, quite often it is better to start with a simple and high volume system rather than a complex system with heavy overages.</p> <h3>3. Start making data-driven decisions.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">One of the most important aspects of easy growth marketing is making decisions based on data. This means <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/innovation-metrics-\" rel=\"noopener\">using data to track your progress</a> and make changes to your strategy as needed. This needs to become ingrained in your business, so the sooner you start, even with limited tracking and data points the better.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: If you haven't done so already make sure at the very least you are using <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Analytics</a> (it's free), and that you are building a live dashboard of metrics that are meaningful to your business (<a href=\"https://datastudio.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Data Studio</a> is useful for this).</p> <h3>4. Create incredible content.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Content is still king when it comes to digital marketing and is an easy growth marketing technique. If you want to grow your business, you need to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create truly incredible content</a>. This doesn't mean it has to be perfect, but it does need to be interesting and valuable to your target audience.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Start with just one topic area and make sure you have covered the entire topic with different articles that satisfy the needs and questions your customers have. Better to be comprehensive and rank well for a few important topics that spread your efforts too thinly.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: If you are not sure where to start just plug your domain into something like Ubersuggest to get a list of valuable keywords in your niche, then look on Quora to find questions that people have posted on these topics. Finally, write content that answers these questions in detail.</p> <h3>5. Start measuring conversions and optimise them.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Conversions are what matters most when it comes to easy growth marketing, but CRO or <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/conversion-rate-optimization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Conversion Rate Optimisation </a>is an infinitely complex area. To make things easy all you need to do is to start tracking conversions on a platform like Google Analytics.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">When you have started to track conversions you will then be able to see where they are coming from and how people are reaching you. The most important thing to do is to take insights from what you see and formulate various hypotheses of how you could improve your marketing.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Once you are comfortable doing this, you can then move on to look at the pages that contribute to each conversion and optimise the customer experience. There are a lot of different ways to do this, with multivariant and A/B testing, but find the one that works best for you and your business and go from there.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Sophisticated tracking software might be overkill in the early stages of CRO, and may even harm the load speed of your website. To make things easy, test in a limited way to incrementally improve your conversion rate and use a tool like <a href=\"https://optimize.google.com/optimize/home/#/accounts\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Optimize</a> (free from Google).</p> <h3>6. Start to plan what you want to test.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Testing is an essential part of easy growth marketing, but before you can start testing, you need to have a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >plan</a>. Figure out what is going to have the biggest impact on your business and then create a plan for how you're going to do it.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">It is important at this stage that you test your assumptions rather than committing to the plan as it stands. Work out the major assumptions that have been made and then find a way to test if they are true, one by one. I guarantee that your plan will change drastically in light of the results you get.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: To make things easier, try not to commit early on to the specifics of a plan, rather, instead have a general direction of travel, and also focus on satisfying customer needs that you can demonstrate through evidence. Finally, make sure every experiment or campaign you undertake can be measured in some way.</p> <h3>7. Focus on the whole customer journey, not just awareness and acquisition.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">An easy way to get a competitive advantage over other companies in your space is to consider the whole of your customer journey. A lot of businesses focus on the top of the funnel, but if you want to grow your business, you need to focus on the entire customer journey.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">This includes everything from awareness, trail, conversion, upsell, and advocacy. Work out what marketing and channels you are using in each of these areas and then decide where you need to place your efforts.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">This is a complex area, and if you are struggling, we do have a service designed exactly to help you make the most of your <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer journey mapping</a>. Please drop us a line to find out more. This easy growth marketing technique is often overlooked.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Ask yourself; If we only work on one thing in the next 6 months what would it be? Are there areas where we don't spend any time or focus? What would be the impact on the business if we did? Should we stop undertaking activity in certain areas?</p> <h3>8. Make sure your website is fit for purpose.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Your website is often the first interaction someone has with your business, so it's important to make sure it's up to par. This means having a well-designed website that is easy to navigate and provides value to your visitors. Also making sure that is visible to search engines and will rank well in the future is critical to easy growth marketing success.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">You will need to consider whether the platform and technology you have chosen will be able to scale over time and whether you will be able to bear the additional costs in your business model. Also, think about how different users will interact with your website do potential customers have as good an experience as logged-in users or paying customers. Quite often if the answer is no, you have a highly evolved product, but a weak marketing function.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">In some extreme cases, it may be easier to ditch your existing website and develop a new one that will scale as your business does. However, in most cases making small website improvements is an easy growth marketing win.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Consider undertaking a <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-audit/technical/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical SEO audit</a>, as well as performing some <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">user testing</a>. In both cases, the additional costs will be more than overweighed by the performance and user experience benefits on your bottom line.</p> <h2 id=\"measure\">Measure success</h2> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Once you've launched your easy growth marketing experiments, it's important to take some time to measure their success or lack thereof. There are many different metrics you could choose to measure, including website traffic, conversion rate, and social media engagement.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">You will need to have a dedicated place to note down these results as well as any insights that were gleaned from the activity. This could be simple and easy as a <a href=\"https://assets.strategyzer.com/assets/resources/the-learning-card.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">learnings card</a>, or a dedicated strategy canvas where results are recorded and analysed.</p> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"399\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image.jpeg 399w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image-214x300.jpeg 214w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" /></figure> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Finally, you'll want to track how the results vary over time, this will give you the warnings and wins so that you can make adjustments as needed.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: An easy growth marketing method of measuring results is just to have a Google Sheet with every experiment and campaign, together with the key metrics that you want to measure.</p> <h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Growth marketing is an incredibly effective way to reach new customers and grow your business. It's also a great way to build brand awareness and loyalty and to get more people talking about your company. Finally, it can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional marketing.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">As the world of marketing continues to evolve, growth marketing will likely become even more popular.
