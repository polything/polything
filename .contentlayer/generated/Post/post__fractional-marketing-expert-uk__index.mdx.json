This is great if your business can afford to recruit a skilled marketer with board-level experience, but what if your business can not bear the cost of a highly-paid executive, or your business is not big enough to justify a full-time role?</p> <p id=\"fa9f305b-31b0-472b-afcf-0579cd74c815\">From CMO&#8217;s to channel specialists, this is where <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/marketing-services/\" >our fractional marketing experts</a> come in.

They guide and manage marketing departments, providing high-level expertise without the full-time cost. This role benefits small to medium-sized businesses and startups.</p> <div> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"720\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-4.png\" alt=\"Fractional Marketing Director\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-4.png 720w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-4-300x125.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure></div> <h3>What experience do they usually have?</h3> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">There are<a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/fractional-marketing-experts-myths/\" > lots of myths</a> around this, but a fractional marketing director is usually a senior marketer who has previously worked in-house at a variety of companies; choosing one who has the correct background for your business will be critical to success. Most will have occupied board-level positions, managed multi-functional teams, and will have experience in building new teams. They will be adept at stakeholder management and also be able to influence at a C-suite level as well as motivate a marketing team.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Engaging with one would typically involve hiring them to work with your company on a part-time or project basis. This can be an especially beneficial arrangement for small and medium-sized businesses or startups that may not have the budget to hire a full-time marketing consultant or director.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Fractional marketing experts can be used to help set strategy, build virtual or in-house marketing teams, oversee and manage marketing plan execution and develop new product offerings.</p> <h2 id=\"benefits\">The benefits of using a fractional marketing expert</h2> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">There are many benefits of working this way, including:</p> <div style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 38%\"><div> <h3>Flexible Commitment</h3> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Access to experienced marketing talent without the high cost or commitment of a full-time hire. This gives your business flexibility in your approach and you can increase or decrease your commitment over time based on your needs. Your business will benefit from the insight and experience that an expert can bring, but only pay for the time you need.</p> <h3>Scalability</h3> <p>The ability to scale your marketing efforts up or down as needed, without a long-term commitment. Many professionals will be prepared to work on a project-by-project basis allowing you to link costs directly with results, making this a very efficient way to work. This can be a great way to start the relationship, by getting some short-term help and building confidence in their abilities.</p> <h3>Experience</h3> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">A good fractional marketing expert will have also been in the industry long enough to have a wealth of contacts that you can utilise as a part of your business. They will be able to identify what functions and activities you are currently missing in your existing plan.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">They will know which marketing suppliers and tech are best suited to your use case, as well as be able to bring in specialists in areas such as SEO or PPC to supplement your own team. If you have limited skills in-house, they can even build you an outsourced fractional marketing team.</p> </div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"543\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image.png\" alt=\"Fraction Marketing Expert Pros &amp; Cons List\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image.png 543w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-271x300.png 271w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px\" /></figure></div> <h3>Perspective</h3> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Perspective is an often under-recognised benefit of using a fractional marketing expert. Because they work on your behalf but are annexed to your business, you will benefit from their greater objectivity.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Quite often an external perspective can be useful to identify issues within your business, that a full-time employee may not feel comfortable voicing. Also due to the nature of working this way a fractional marketer will not get caught up in the politics of your business, and are there to deliver rather than climb a corporate ladder or bolster their CV.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">As a result, they will focus on your business needs and the role you have assigned them to deliver on your objectives.</p> <h3>Marketing Rigour</h3> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">A good fractional marketing expert will be able to enforce some rigour into your marketing function. Marketing ultimately exists to grow your business profitably. Having a senior manager looking after the needs of your business, rather than working on vanity projects, will have a positive impact on your bottom line.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Tasks such as implementing processes, measuring effectiveness, customer research, and understanding lifetime value should become much clearer within your business. They will also instil this rigour within your existing team, as well as be able to teach best practices and call out poor performance.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">These are just some of the few benefits your business will enjoy by using a fractional marketing expert, but if you are still not sure, there are some <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/why-a-fractional-marketing-director/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">key signs</a> that your business could need one.</p> <h2 id=\"choose\">Choosing the right one for your needs</h2> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">When choosing a fractional marketing expert, it&#8217;s important to consider their skills, experience, and areas of expertise. You&#8217;ll also want to make sure that they&#8217;re a good fit for your company culture and that they understand your business goals.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Here are a few tips to help you choose the right person for your needs:</p> <div> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"852\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-2.png\" alt=\"Choosing a Fractional Marketing Expert\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-2.png 852w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-2-300x131.png 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/image-2-768x336.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" /></figure></div> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\"><strong>1. Define your needs. </strong>Before you start your search, take some time to think about what you need from them. What skills and expertise do you require? What kind of personality do you want them to have? What is your budget? Once you have a good understanding of your needs, you&#8217;ll be able to narrow down your search.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\"><strong>2. Do your research. </strong>Once you know what you&#8217;re looking for, it&#8217;s time to start your research.

You can also ask for recommendations from friends or business contacts who have used one in the past.</p> <p id=\"d41677a0-0b92-47d4-a654-1f6bcaa5aa9f\"><strong>3. Compare proposals</strong>. Once you&#8217;ve found a few fractional marketing experts that you&#8217;re interested in working with, ask them to provide you with a proposal outlining their services and fees. This will give you a chance to compare apples to apples and make sure that you&#8217;re getting the best value for your money.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\"><strong>4. Ask for references.</strong> Before making your final decision, be sure to ask each of the prospects you&#8217;re considering for a list of references. This will give you a chance to speak with other business owners or marketing professionals who have worked with them in the past and get a sense of their quality of work and professionalism.</p> <div> <figure><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/brand-audit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Differentiation-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:761px;height:auto\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Differentiation-1024x576.png 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Differentiation-300x169.png 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Differentiation-768x432.png 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Differentiation.png 1120w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></div> <h2 id=\"tips\">Tips on how to get started&nbsp;</h2> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Once you&#8217;ve found the perfect fractional marketing expert for your needs, it&#8217;s time to get started.
