What is agile marketing?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>Agile marketing is a method of planning that uses incremental development. It focuses on delivering value over time instead of trying to create the perfect plan upfront. Agile helps marketers, product managers and businesses deliver quality work faster by breaking down large chunks of work into manageable pieces. This allows teams to meet deadlines more effectively while also allowing them to adapt to changes throughout the process.</p> <h2 id=\"Why-use-agile\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>2. Why use agile marketing?</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>Today, the marketing landscape is constantly changing. With new technologies and social media platforms emerging every day, it&#8217;s difficult to keep up with everything that you need to do in order to market your company effectively. But there is a solution: agile marketing. Agile helps marketers deliver quality work faster by breaking down large chunks of work into manageable.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are the Advantages of Agile Marketing?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Agile marketing allows for flexibility and adaptability in developing a plan, taking into account that changes can happen quickly within today&#8217;s digital age. This type of planning takes place through short sprints which have specific goals to reach overtime, whereas traditional plans involve long-term budgets and timeframes.</p> <p>Customers want a two-way dialogue with companies now more than ever before, which agile gives them the opportunity to do through personalised customer journeys. Agile marketing also reduces risks involved in planning as it allows businesses to quickly adapt to any changes within their industry or the behaviours of customers. This type of marketing is suitable for any business or industry because it is flexible and adaptable.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are the Advantages of Agile Marketing?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>There are no disadvantages to agile marketing, as long as you have a good understanding of how it works. It only requires an initial time investment in order to learn about new concepts before fully implementing them into your business. The key element is to be able to instil cultural change within your existing marketing team or build a new team that understands this methodology.</p> <p>What are the steps to building an agile marketing plan?</p> <p>&#8211; Understand the concept of agile</p> <p>&#8211; Learn about its team structure and roles that are involved in it</p> <p>&#8211; Communicate with your marketing department to build a new culture within the company based on this methodology</p> <p>&#8211; Implement these steps into your business by breaking down tasks, creating sprints and focusing on delivering results.</p> <h2 id=\"process-of-agile\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>3. The process of creating an agile marketing plan</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The process of creating an agile marketing plan should break down into three different areas: the backlog, sprints and reporting. Regular retrospectives and daily standups are also important to check in with your team and make sure everyone is on the same page.</p> <p>&#8211; First, you should figure out what needs to be done (the backlog), as well as prioritising those tasks</p> <p>&#8211; Once completed, it&#8217;s time to create sprints and assign different parts of your plan into these sprints</p> <p>&#8211; Once those steps are completed, it&#8217;s time to create sprints and assign different parts of your plan into these sprints</p> <p>&#8211; You should also schedule a retrospective at the end of each sprint where you can discuss what went well and which areas need improvement. This is important in order to improve going forward</p> <p>&#8211; Once all tasks have been completed within a project, it&#8217;s time to report on the results and see how you can improve for next time.</p> <p>The three main steps in creating an agile marketing plan: breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable sprints; having a culture where people check in with each other daily and reporting back at the end of every project.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Backlog</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>A product owner must first develop a prioritised list of features that need to be developed in order for the final product to meet end-user expectations as well as provide value (the &#8216;backlog&#8217;). This list is often called the &#8216;backlog&#8217; and serves as a reminder of what needs to be done, in priority order.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Sprints</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Once you have determined your backlog items, develop an incremental list of work that will help get them completed (called sprints). At regular intervals (usually between one week and four weeks), take stock of where you&#8217;re at and plan where you want to go. This is a good time for product owners, developers and testers to meet together in order to validate that they are going down the right path with development as well as identify any obstacles which may be slowing them down or stopping them from achieving their goals.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Reporting</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Marketing directors can then use the reports generated by the marketing team to evaluate their progress. You can continue to incrementally develop your product/service, building upon what you have already done, using an agile approach.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Daily Standup Meetings</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Daily Standups are a great way to get everyone on the same page, no matter what they are working on. This allows them to communicate effectively and ensure that there is never any overlap or misunderstandings when it comes to their roles. Standups should only last between 15-20 minutes so that your team can quickly go through all of the necessary updates without wasting too.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Retrospectives</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Retrospectives are crucial for agile teams because they allow them to reflect on what has happened in the past and then decide how best to move forward. This allows companies to identify any problems that may have occurred, regardless of whether it was something small or large so that everyone can work out where improvements need to be made before the next sprint.</p> <h2 id=\"How-to-write-an-agile-plan\">4. <strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How to write an agile marketing plan</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >An effective marketing strategy</a> should start with a customer-centric view of all business functions and processes within the organisation so that everyone is working towards the same goal. This will ensure that they are all heading in the right direction and remain aligned, no matter where they sit within the organisation.</p> <p>An agile marketing plan should be created after you have completed your business strategy or SWOT analysis and decided on a budget for your marketing activities as well as what resources you need to complete them.</p> <p>The first step is to gather all your resources and decide who will be responsible for each activity, as well as how long it should take them to complete their task/activity. This information needs to go into the backlog so that you can identify what you need by when in order to achieve your goals on time. You may also want to outline the process for prioritising items in your backlog if there are multiple activities that need to be completed at the same time.</p> <p>Thoroughly plan out each activity on an individual basis before looking at how they all tie together into one cohesive strategy. Consider what different types of goals you have, whether it&#8217;s improving brand awareness or increasing sales leads &#8211; and what your timelines are for each of these activities.</p> <p>Once you have completed this step, take a look at how all the pieces fit together to create an overall marketing strategy that is integrated and coherent enough to meet your business goals. You should then start working on individual sprints (or mini strategies) in order to get things done more quickly so that you can get a better idea of whether it&#8217;s going to be successful or not.</p> <p>An agile marketing plan is an effective way for companies to manage their digital presence and respond more quickly to customer demands by providing them with exactly what they want when they want it. It requires organisations to work together as one cohesive team so that everyone knows who is responsible for what. Agile marketing is a popular strategy because it allows companies to focus on their business more than ever before, without having to worry about whether they will have the resources available at any given time.</p> <p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning how an agile approach can help your company with its digital presence and content marketing activities, we invite you to get in touch with us today.

Tools to help you create your own plan</strong></h2> <h3><strong><strong>Kanban Boards</strong></strong></h3> <p>These are a great way to visualise your backlog and create a sense of transparency that everyone in the company can see exactly how things are going.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jira</a> &#8211; is a popular choice for agile teams because it makes collaboration easy due to its flexible configuration, user-friendly interface and powerful reporting features. It allows you to track bugs or add new tasks quickly so that you can get on with building your product.</p> <p><a href=\"https://miro.com/templates/lean-canvas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lean Canvas </a>&#8211; is a helpful tool that enables teams to create their own Lean Startup business model canvas, which outlines the key components of an effective lean marketing strategy. It allows companies to visualise what they need in order to build something new and bring it to market successfully so that everyone knows exactly what they need to do and by when.</p> <p><a href=\"https://trello.com/en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trello</a> &#8211; is a project management tool that is used to create Kanban boards or lists, depending on the type of agile methodology you want to implement. It allows teams to get organised and track their progress so they know exactly where they are at all times during the product development cycle.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong>Digital Asset Management Systems (DAM)</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>DAM is really important for agile marketing teams because they enable the entire team to have access to all of their assets at any time so that nothing gets left behind.</p> <p>It&#8217;s really important for companies to keep track of new content being added and when it was created, in order to make sure that there isn&#8217;t any unnecessary duplication or re-use going on which can affect</p> <h2 id=\"How-to-get-started\"><strong>6.<strong> How to get started with the process of writing an agile marketing plan&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2> <p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >how an agile approach can help your company</a> with its digital presence and content marketing activities, we invite you to <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/contact/\">get in touch</a> with us today.

Takeaways:</strong></strong></h2> <p>&#8211; Agile marketing is a flexible and adaptable approach to planning that reduces the risk involved in developing strategies for your business</p> <p>&#8211; It allows you to take advantage of opportunities as they arise within today&#8217;s fast-moving digital world</p> <p>&#8211; Teams are assigned specific goals which are broken down into shorter periods of time called sprints, whereas traditional</p> <p>Agile marketing provides an advantage for any company or brand because it allows them to quickly adapt to the fast-paced nature of today&#8217;s digital age.
