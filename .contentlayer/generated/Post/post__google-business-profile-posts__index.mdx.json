By creating a Google Business Profile and posting regularly, businesses can improve their visibility online, and build trust and credibility with potential customers. Google says &#8220;Your Business Profile on Google Search and Maps can help you attract new customers and grow your business.&#8221;</p> <ol> <li>What are Google business profile posts?</li> <li>Types of Google Profile Business Posts that you can use</li> <li>How to create a post</li> <li>Why you should use posts to promote your business:</li> </ol> <h2>What are Google business profile posts?</h2> <p id=\"3633d263-08d1-4761-b47e-54b3141118de\">With Google business profile posts business owners can post updates about their business that are associated with their profile. These posts help existing and new customers know more about your business.</p> <p id=\"3633d263-08d1-4761-b47e-54b3141118de\">The posts are a bit like Facebook posts in that they can be reshared from your profile and posted onto other social networks or via email. Unfortunately, unlike social networks, users cannot like or comment on your posts or share within the ecosystem as users do not have their own profiles.</p> <p id=\"3633d263-08d1-4761-b47e-54b3141118de\">Users will see these posts in a variety of places including Google Maps environments including the app, SERPS, and Local Search:</p> <figure><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=polything+marketing+consultancy&amp;oq=polything+marketing+consultancy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.12590j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/image-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Polything Marketing Consultancy Google Business Profile\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/image-1.jpeg 700w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/image-1-300x254.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></figure> <h2>Types of posts you can use:</h2> <p id=\"cc0c2873-d4e2-4fdc-ac38-232e4a0e5132\">There are a few different types of posts you can use on your Google Profile Business page.</p> <h3>What&#8217;s new</h3> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">These posts are general updates on your business, it is easy to include photos or videos, a description together with an action button to lead users to find out more. They can be used for updates on opening hours, promotions, or things like address changes.</p> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">These types of posts are great for building brand awareness and affinity and in some countries also get surfaced automatically by Google based on your reviews rating and search intent.</p> <h3>Events</h3> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">If you&#8217;re hosting an event, using Google Business Profile is a great way to promote it. You can share event details, such as the date, time (start and end), location, and a brief description. As with What&#8217;s New posts, these posts can include photos, videos, descriptions, and action buttons.</p> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">Customers will be able to see your event posts in Google Maps and Google Search. Events under some circumstances can be surfaced on your business in the Overview section of your business profile, Google does not publish what the criteria are for this to happen, however. All events will appear in the Events section of your knowledge panel in SERPS.</p> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">These posts are great for driving action and attendance as well as building affinity with your audience.</p> <h3>Offers</h3> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">You can use these types of posts to share offers with your customers. As with the previous post types, you will be able to include the same information and media, but with this type of post, you will also need to include a title and start and end dates for the offer. In addition, you can also include links, Ts&amp;Cs, and even give your offer a coupon code for redemptions.</p> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">These posts offer more flexibility to craft a great offer, as well as appear near the top of your profile in the knowledge panel. They will also appear in the Updates tab section nearer the bottom of the profile.</p> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">This is a great way to drive traffic to your business and generate sales. By utilising coupons you will be also able to measure the impact of using these posts on your profile.</p> <h3>COVID-19</h3> <p id=\"3a75a1d5-034b-4713-96ba-34b7dfe7752a\">Near the start of the pandemic, Google introduced a new type of post specifically for businesses to share their COVID-19 updates. Although less relevant for most businesses now, this is where you can include changes to your business hours, any new safety measures you have put in place, or even temporary closures. At the time this was a useful way for businesses to build trust with their customers and let them know which COVID-19 measures they had in place.</p> <h2>How to create a Google Profile Business Post</h2> <p id=\"4a4411f1-077c-40b6-82f7-3b0581ad12f6\">Creating a post is relatively straightforward,&nbsp;to create a Google Profile Business Post:</p> <ol> <li>Sign in to Google My Business.</li> <li>Choose the location you&#8217;d like to manage.</li> <li>Click Posts from the menu.</li> <li>In the top right, click Write a post.</li> <li>Choose the type of post you&#8217;d like to create.</li> <li>Enter the details of your post, then click Publish.</li> </ol> <h2>Why you should use posts to promote your business:</h2> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">There are a few key reasons why you should use Google Profile Business Posts to promote your business:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Reach a wider audience:</strong> By creating a Google Business Profile and posting regularly, businesses can improve their visibility online and reach a wider audience.
