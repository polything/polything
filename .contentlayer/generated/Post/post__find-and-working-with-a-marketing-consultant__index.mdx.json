You&#8217;re responsible for marketing your company, generating leads, selling products or services, and handling customer service &#8211; just to name a few things. It&#8217;s no wonder that so many founders of direct-to-consumer businesses feel overwhelmed and stressed out.</p> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">One way to take some of the pressure off is to hire a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >marketing consultant</a>, which allows you to focus on growing your business rather than building your marketing function. The benefits of working with an independent practitioner are access to specialist marketing skills and knowledge, fresh ideas and perspectives, an objective viewpoint, additional capacity, and bandwidth.

And what do they do?</h2> <p id=\"what\">They are independent professionals who will come into your business on a temporary or part-time basis to grow your marketing function.

As experts in their field, are also able to refine your value proposition and deliver you a cost-effective go-to-market strategy for your business.</p> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">They will usually start by auditing your customers, business, and any marketing that has been done to date, before formulating a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >strategic direction based on your business plan</a>, followed by a marketing plan. They can often help you with executing that plan, whether that be with in-house staff or freelancers from their network.</p> <h2 id=\"grow\">How can they help your business grow?</h2> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-300x200.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-768x512.jpg 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">Marketing consultants can help your business grow by providing a fresh perspective on your marketing, and offering innovative directions, or technical solutions that you might not have thought about. They can also help you to execute your marketing plan more effectively, and provide guidance and support on how to streamline the process and make the most out of your budget. </p> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">With their extensive experience, they should be able to make sure that you have a good product-market fit and make sure that your business objectives are underpinned by the correct level of marketing support. They should also be able to help you find new customer segments that maybe you have never considered, and help you understand which customers are profitable and therefore who to focus your marketing on.</p> <h2 id=\"benefits\">What are the benefits to your business?</h2> <h3>Perspective</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">The key advantage of working with a freelance marketing consultant is that they are annexed to your business and should give you an honest appraisal of where opportunities might lie, as well as highlight the shortcomings at a strategic and tactical level. Very few employees and even fewer agencies will feel comfortable giving this type of feedback. They will also be much more familiar with the marketing and consumer trends as well as the consumer research that is available.</p> <h3>Diagnosing Problems</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">A good consultant should have enough practical experience to give you absolute clarity on what is working and what is not, furthermore what you need to do to fix things. From broken campaigns, teams, conversion funnels, or communication, good practitioners should have a wide breadth of knowledge of the whole marketing function to be able to diagnose and fix all marketing-related problems often saving you huge amounts of money in the process.</p> <h3>Capacity</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">A consultant is a great option if your company is growing, you are strapped for resources, or you have been unable to hire anyone of the right calibre in-house. They should be able to help plug the gaps in more senior functions such as strategy development and budgeting, but also help you move more quickly by implementing a marketing plan. Many will also be able to make introductions to key personnel you need to hire or even build virtual teams on your behalf.</p> <h3>Accountability</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">Most practitioners have previously been in senior marketing in-house roles, so they should more than comfortable with assuming responsibility within your organization. They will be adept at delivering complex marketing plans and keeping your staff and third-party suppliers and agencies on track. They should be a safe pair of hands that you can rely on, but also flag issues with delivery whether that be inside or outside your organization. A surprising benefit of using an independent consultant is that they may even keep you more accountable!</p> <h2 id=\"find\">How to find and work with a consultant</h2> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">n today’s fast-paced business environment, bringing in a consultant can be a game-changer.
