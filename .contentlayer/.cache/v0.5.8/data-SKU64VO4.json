After assessing resourcing, we formed a consensus that the in-house teams could not deliver the plan alone.</p> <p>WOLF appointed Polything to deliver ongoing strategy, programme management on the project, campaign activation and creative production. We operated as an extension of the in-house team, managing other suppliers and projects, managing the programme and upskilling in-house teams.

You might be thinking about expanding into new markets, launching a new product, or need to increase profitability. But have you considered how [growth marketing](https://polything.co.uk/) examples could help you with these goals?\n\nThere are many benefits to growth marketing for businesses. This article will explore six of the most important benefits of growth marketing. By understanding these benefits, you can see why growth marketing is so essential for businesses looking to achieve continued success. <h2>What is growth marketing? Growth vs Marketing</h2> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\"><a href=\"https://blog.useproof.com/what-is-growth-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Growth marketing</a> is a customer-centric approach to business growth that focuses on identifying and exploiting new growth opportunities. By taking a ><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Growth hacking </a>and growth marketing are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but there is a key difference between the two. Growth hacking is a more tactical approach to growth that focuses on using quick and dirty methods to achieve growth goals.</p> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">Growth marketing, on the other hand, is a more strategic and >By adopting a growth marketing methodology it will help your business grow in the following ways:</p> <h3>Uncover new market opportunities</h3> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">Growth marketing is all about finding <a href=\"https://www.productmarketingalliance.com/8-ways-to-identify-opportunities-in-the-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new opportunities for growth</a>. By taking a >Growth marketing enables businesses to make more effective use of their budgets. By allocating budgets based on <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/experimentlibrarya149\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data, and experiments</a>, companies can ensure that they are spending money on the most effective growth strategies. Growth marketing helps businesses generate higher-quality leads. By taking a strategic approach to lead generation, businesses can improve the quality of their leads and close more deals. This in turn improves retention and lifetime value.</p> <h3>Evolve your products and services in conjunction with your customer base</h3> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">By taking [a strategic approach](https://polything.co.uk/approach/), one of the key benefits of growth marketing is that it creates [customer-centric products](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/starting-with-the-customer) and organisations. This means that businesses can focus on their customers’ needs and wants, rather than just selling them products or services. By radically shifting this focus from product to consumers organisations can build better products, reach their consumers more efficiently, at the right times and build longer-term relationships with consumers that have greater value.</p> <h3>Strategy focused</h3> <p id=\"b84dab97-c319-4f82-97d5-f03f13028928\">Another key benefit of growth marketing is that it provides a focus on strategy, rather than tactics. Trust in the process is key to developing an effective growth marketing strategy. Understanding the iterative nature and small incremental improvements will ultimately result in big breakthroughs in understanding as well as direct. This means that businesses can start developing long-term plans and objectives, rather than obsessing over short-term tactical wins.</p> <h3>Cross-functional collaboration</h3> <p id=\"3583ef6d-88f7-4261-bf00-9c1cf57db414\">Another benefit of growth marketing is that it enables businesses to collaborate more effectively across functions. This is because it recognises that no one department or individual can achieve growth on their own. Adopting an organisational North Star for the business creates clarity for everyone and provides context to make any decision within the business (e.g. If in accounts we'd do X does it have a positive or negative impact on Y='Our North Star').</p> <h3>Organisational alignment</h3> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">Growth marketing also creates <a href=\"https://pingboard.com/blog/why-you-should-spend-more-time-thinking-about-organizational-alignment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">organisational alignment</a>, which is essential for businesses that want to be successful. This is achieved by aligning the organisation’s goals, objectives, and strategies with its marketing efforts. Every department within the organisation will start to pull together to see each of its functions through the prism of how they can contribute to the North Star. Alignment of your whole business at a strategic level is a major benefit of growth marketing.</p> <h3>Data-informed decision making</h3> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">An additional benefit of growth marketing is led by >A benefit of growth marketing is that hunches can be tested, at a much smaller scale, with a valid hypothesis that will return a result that can be validated before committing large amounts of time, effort, and money to ideas that may be driven by ego alone.</p> <h3>Increases profits</h3> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">Finally, by its very nature, a benefit of growth marketing is that it is focused on increasing profits for businesses. This is achieved by identifying and exploiting new growth opportunities, creating a better product/market fit, as well as pursuing efficiencies in all areas of the business. When implemented correctly it can completely change the fortunes of an ailing business.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">The benefits of growth marketing are essential for businesses that want to see continued success, particularly in markets that are constantly evolving and an environment where consumers' time is at a premium. By taking a strategic approach to lead generation, product development, and marketing, businesses can increase profits and build longer-term relationships with consumers.</p> <p id=\"004c2c12-ec02-464c-96a8-0e9f82b9fb03\">If you are not sure <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/starting-with-growth-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to do growth marketing</a>, or you would like to explore how Polything could help you develop a growth marketing plan, <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">please drop us a line</a> to find out more.</p> <hr /> <div style=\"grid-template-columns:32% auto\"><figure style=\"background-image:url(https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-1024x640.png);background-position:50% 50%\"><a href=\"https://chris-q9avi0iq.scoreapp.com/p/the-distinctive-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-1024x640.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-1024x640.png 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-300x188.png 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-768x480.png 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure><div> <h4>Is your brand truly distinctive? </h4> <p>Many brands struggle to carve out a unique space in their market.

What is agile marketing?</strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>Agile marketing is a method of planning that uses incremental development. It focuses on delivering value over time instead of trying to create the perfect plan upfront. Agile helps marketers, product managers and businesses deliver quality work faster by breaking down large chunks of work into manageable pieces. This allows teams to meet deadlines more effectively while also allowing them to adapt to changes throughout the process.</p> <h2 id=\"Why-use-agile\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>2. Why use agile marketing?</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>Today, the marketing landscape is constantly changing. With new technologies and social media platforms emerging every day, it&#8217;s difficult to keep up with everything that you need to do in order to market your company effectively. But there is a solution: agile marketing. Agile helps marketers deliver quality work faster by breaking down large chunks of work into manageable.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are the Advantages of Agile Marketing?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Agile marketing allows for flexibility and adaptability in developing a plan, taking into account that changes can happen quickly within today&#8217;s digital age. This type of planning takes place through short sprints which have specific goals to reach overtime, whereas traditional plans involve long-term budgets and timeframes.</p> <p>Customers want a two-way dialogue with companies now more than ever before, which agile gives them the opportunity to do through personalised customer journeys. Agile marketing also reduces risks involved in planning as it allows businesses to quickly adapt to any changes within their industry or the behaviours of customers. This type of marketing is suitable for any business or industry because it is flexible and adaptable.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are the Advantages of Agile Marketing?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>There are no disadvantages to agile marketing, as long as you have a good understanding of how it works. It only requires an initial time investment in order to learn about new concepts before fully implementing them into your business. The key element is to be able to instil cultural change within your existing marketing team or build a new team that understands this methodology.</p> <p>What are the steps to building an agile marketing plan?</p> <p>&#8211; Understand the concept of agile</p> <p>&#8211; Learn about its team structure and roles that are involved in it</p> <p>&#8211; Communicate with your marketing department to build a new culture within the company based on this methodology</p> <p>&#8211; Implement these steps into your business by breaking down tasks, creating sprints and focusing on delivering results.</p> <h2 id=\"process-of-agile\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>3. The process of creating an agile marketing plan</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2> <p>The process of creating an agile marketing plan should break down into three different areas: the backlog, sprints and reporting. Regular retrospectives and daily standups are also important to check in with your team and make sure everyone is on the same page.</p> <p>&#8211; First, you should figure out what needs to be done (the backlog), as well as prioritising those tasks</p> <p>&#8211; Once completed, it&#8217;s time to create sprints and assign different parts of your plan into these sprints</p> <p>&#8211; Once those steps are completed, it&#8217;s time to create sprints and assign different parts of your plan into these sprints</p> <p>&#8211; You should also schedule a retrospective at the end of each sprint where you can discuss what went well and which areas need improvement. This is important in order to improve going forward</p> <p>&#8211; Once all tasks have been completed within a project, it&#8217;s time to report on the results and see how you can improve for next time.</p> <p>The three main steps in creating an agile marketing plan: breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable sprints; having a culture where people check in with each other daily and reporting back at the end of every project.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Backlog</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>A product owner must first develop a prioritised list of features that need to be developed in order for the final product to meet end-user expectations as well as provide value (the &#8216;backlog&#8217;). This list is often called the &#8216;backlog&#8217; and serves as a reminder of what needs to be done, in priority order.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Sprints</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Once you have determined your backlog items, develop an incremental list of work that will help get them completed (called sprints). At regular intervals (usually between one week and four weeks), take stock of where you&#8217;re at and plan where you want to go. This is a good time for product owners, developers and testers to meet together in order to validate that they are going down the right path with development as well as identify any obstacles which may be slowing them down or stopping them from achieving their goals.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Reporting</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Marketing directors can then use the reports generated by the marketing team to evaluate their progress. You can continue to incrementally develop your product/service, building upon what you have already done, using an agile approach.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Daily Standup Meetings</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Daily Standups are a great way to get everyone on the same page, no matter what they are working on. This allows them to communicate effectively and ensure that there is never any overlap or misunderstandings when it comes to their roles. Standups should only last between 15-20 minutes so that your team can quickly go through all of the necessary updates without wasting too.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Retrospectives</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>Retrospectives are crucial for agile teams because they allow them to reflect on what has happened in the past and then decide how best to move forward. This allows companies to identify any problems that may have occurred, regardless of whether it was something small or large so that everyone can work out where improvements need to be made before the next sprint.</p> <h2 id=\"How-to-write-an-agile-plan\">4. <strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How to write an agile marketing plan</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >An effective marketing strategy</a> should start with a customer-centric view of all business functions and processes within the organisation so that everyone is working towards the same goal. This will ensure that they are all heading in the right direction and remain aligned, no matter where they sit within the organisation.</p> <p>An agile marketing plan should be created after you have completed your business strategy or SWOT analysis and decided on a budget for your marketing activities as well as what resources you need to complete them.</p> <p>The first step is to gather all your resources and decide who will be responsible for each activity, as well as how long it should take them to complete their task/activity. This information needs to go into the backlog so that you can identify what you need by when in order to achieve your goals on time. You may also want to outline the process for prioritising items in your backlog if there are multiple activities that need to be completed at the same time.</p> <p>Thoroughly plan out each activity on an individual basis before looking at how they all tie together into one cohesive strategy. Consider what different types of goals you have, whether it&#8217;s improving brand awareness or increasing sales leads &#8211; and what your timelines are for each of these activities.</p> <p>Once you have completed this step, take a look at how all the pieces fit together to create an overall marketing strategy that is integrated and coherent enough to meet your business goals. You should then start working on individual sprints (or mini strategies) in order to get things done more quickly so that you can get a better idea of whether it&#8217;s going to be successful or not.</p> <p>An agile marketing plan is an effective way for companies to manage their digital presence and respond more quickly to customer demands by providing them with exactly what they want when they want it. It requires organisations to work together as one cohesive team so that everyone knows who is responsible for what. Agile marketing is a popular strategy because it allows companies to focus on their business more than ever before, without having to worry about whether they will have the resources available at any given time.</p> <p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning how an agile approach can help your company with its digital presence and content marketing activities, we invite you to get in touch with us today.

Tools to help you create your own plan</strong></h2> <h3><strong><strong>Kanban Boards</strong></strong></h3> <p>These are a great way to visualise your backlog and create a sense of transparency that everyone in the company can see exactly how things are going.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Jira</a> &#8211; is a popular choice for agile teams because it makes collaboration easy due to its flexible configuration, user-friendly interface and powerful reporting features.

It allows companies to visualise what they need in order to build something new and bring it to market successfully so that everyone knows exactly what they need to do and by when.</p> <p><a href=\"https://trello.com/en-GB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Trello</a> &#8211; is a project management tool that is used to create Kanban boards or lists, depending on the type of agile methodology you want to implement. It allows teams to get organised and track their progress so they know exactly where they are at all times during the product development cycle.</p> <h3><strong><strong><strong>Digital Asset Management Systems (DAM)</strong></strong></strong></h3> <p>DAM is really important for agile marketing teams because they enable the entire team to have access to all of their assets at any time so that nothing gets left behind.</p> <p>It&#8217;s really important for companies to keep track of new content being added and when it was created, in order to make sure that there isn&#8217;t any unnecessary duplication or re-use going on which can affect</p> <h2 id=\"How-to-get-started\"><strong>6.<strong> How to get started with the process of writing an agile marketing plan&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2> <p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >how an agile approach can help your company</a> with its digital presence and content marketing activities, we invite you to <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/contact/\">get in touch</a> with us today.

There are types of content marketing, but there are now more than 1 billion blogs in the world which means that there is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSOFzxu5m4M&amp;t=13s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a blog for every 7.5 people in the world</a> (source: Neil Patel).</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">This is important because it is no longer easy to create a simple blog and get a load of free traffic from Google Search. Your approach has to be more sophisticated and aligned with your target audience. But don&#8217;t worry, read on, and we will show you the basics of content marketing that will bring results.</p> <figure><div> <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Here’s Why I Don’t Blog As Often as I Used To\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2j01xvvE0o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div></figure> <h2 id=\"basic\">What are the basic content marketing principles?</h2> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">If you want to be successful with content marketing, there are some basic principles that you need to follow. These are:</p> <h3 id=\"research-and-know-your-audience\">Research and know your audience</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Take the time to research your audience and develop a better understanding of what they&#8217;re looking for, what they need help with, and how you can add value to their lives. When you know your audience well, you can create content that speaks directly to their needs and pain points and does so in language that is helpful and credible.</p> <h3 id=\"build-a-strategy\">Build a strategy</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Before embarking on a content marketing programme it is critical to understand how and why you are undertaking this. Maybe your revenue is declining or you are launching a new product, in each of these examples your strategy will be wildly different depending on your business goals. If you need help defining a strategy we have <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">content marketing services</a> that can help.</p> <h3 id=\"align-your-marketing-channels-to-the-ones-your-audience-use\">Align your marketing channels to the ones your audience use</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">A TV executive once said to me &#8220;Content is King, but Distribution is King Kong&#8221;. The best content in the world is useless if your audience never sees it. People have become used to content finding them, rather than them having to find the right content.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Therefore, you must ensure that you align your content with the marketing channels your audience uses most. This means understanding what platforms they use (e.g., social media, search, email marketing, etc.), as well as the formats that they prefer to consume (e.g., articles, videos, etc.).</p> <h3 id=\"create-a-human-tone-of-voice-for-your-brand\">Create a human tone of voice for your brand</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">This is one of the most overlooked but crucial areas of content marketing, as our content needs to have a human voice that is relatable and trustworthy. This is relatively easy to create if you have brand pillars or a <a href=\"https://www.bigpicturebranding.com/blog/how-to-determine-your-5-brand-pillars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">strategic brand triangle</a>. if not it might be a good idea to work out what your brand or business stands for and build a brand personality.</p> <div> <figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bce1e8d01232c3e2b669caa/1544040752010-AKY625BDYOHNMBLJX1UD/brand-strategy-triangle-1200.png?format=750w\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /><figcaption>Image Credit: Big-picture branding</figcaption></figure></div> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Either way to build an editorial tone of voice it is important to consider what language you will use, and more importantly, what language you won&#8217;t use as well as what topics and conversations you will engage with. To formalise this it is quite often useful to create a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">content playbook</a>.</p> <h3 id=\"be-consistent\">Be Consistent</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">One of the main principles of content marketing is to be consistent with your messaging, frequency and quality. This can be challenging if you are a small team or business, but there are ways to make this easier. Perhaps you can build a bank of evergreen content that can be used as a resource when things get busy, or you might want to consider using a content calendar to help plan and organise your content in advance.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Also, consider starting with a very low frequency, and building the volume over time once you understand what types and topics of content work best for your audience.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Whatever approach you take, the most important thing is to be consistent with your content marketing, as this is what will help you gain the trust of your audience and keep them coming back for more.

This is probably the most important aspect of content marketing. Your content needs to be valuable and relevant, so you might like to check out <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/what-makes-a-good-blog/\" >what makes a good blog</a>.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">To ensure that it is, refer back to your research and make sure that each piece is tackling a problem or pain your audience has or is fulfilling a need for them to achieve something. An example might be to create a tool that simplifies a complex task (yes this is content), and it might have a better value long-term than just publishing an article on the subject.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">To do this, refer back to your research and gain consensus within your business on the biggest pains your customers have. Rank these pains in order of importance. This is your initial list of content ideas.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Once ranked you can then have an ideation session to work out what content will be most relevant and useful for each pain. From this process, a natural path should become clear in terms of the format, structure and channel for the piece of content.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">You maybe be able to produce content in-house with your existing team, or you may need to hire an agency or freelancers to help you with writing, design, and video production. There are many ways to resource this, so don&#8217;t be afraid to <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/book-a-discovery-call/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ask for help</a>. Also, refer back to your strategy to see what makes sense and is viable for your business.</p> <p>Finally here are <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/four-best-content-marketing-examples-unknown-companies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8 content examples</a> from small brands that we can learn from.</p> <h2 id=\"marketing\">How to start marketing content</h2> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Remember the quote about King Kong? Content doesn&#8217;t just appear on people&#8217;s radars. You need to put content in front of your target audience at the right time in the buying cycle. There are a number of ways you can do this, but social media and email marketing are two of the most cost-effective.</p> <h3 id=\"email-marketing\">Email marketing</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Email marketing may seem a bit outdated channel, but in fact, HubSpot cited Litmus&#8217; research in its recent <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?utm_campaign=2020%20State%20of%20Marketing%20&amp;utm_source=Blog%20CTA&amp;hsCtaTracking=6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877%7C34a15897-4b09-4651-8375-c23ec2a46845\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State of Marketing Report (2022)</a> as returning &#8220;$42 for every $1 spent&#8221;, which is an incredible 4,200% ROI. It is clear that it is still one of the most powerful channels for promoting content. The key benefit is that it allows you to reach a wide audience with your message, can be highly targeted and is relatively low cost.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">When emailing your list, make sure that you segment it so that you are only sending relevant content to those who will find it useful. No one wants to receive emails that are not relevant to them, and this will just lead to people unsubscribing from your list.</p> <h3 id=\"social-media\">Social media</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Social media is a great way to amplify your content and reach a wider audience. It allows you to connect with your audience and build relationships with them. Most platforms now have both organic and paid-for services.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Organic reach on social media has <a href=\"https://www.business.com/articles/surviving-facebook-organic-reach-decline/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">definitely been declining</a> but that doesn&#8217;t mean that if you are on a limited budget, you shouldn&#8217;t explore this route. However, you will need to ensure that your content is optimised for each platform and is able to be consumed on-platform, rather than redirecting users off the network. Often newer social networks will have greater organic reach per follower than older ones.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\"><strong>Tip</strong>: Take advantage of new services or post types and use them because these will receive more reach than older formats.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Paid Social is a very complex area, and to cover everything in this article would take too much of your time. The best methodology is to start small with small budgets and then test and learn as you go. We provide paid social marketing services, so drop us a line if you would like to <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/book-a-discovery-call/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">learn more</a>.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\"><strong>Tip</strong>: Check each platform&#8217;s promotion options and bidding strategy and ensure that they are optimised for your content goals (i.e. do you want users to engage with the content, raise brand awareness, or undertake a specific action for example sign up for an event.) It will also depend on your overarching strategy as to whether you are marketing to new audiences or warming up an existing audience.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Finally, when promoting your content on social media, make sure that you are active and engaging with your audience. Don&#8217;t just post and run, take the time to respond to comments and answer any questions people have. Also, use it as a way to research your audience in more depth. Validate your content ideas before creating content and find out what your audience&#8217;s most pressing pains and needs are.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Both email marketing and social media are great ways to get your content in front of your target audience, but there are other channels you can explore as well. These include:</p> <ul> <li>Search engine marketing</li> <li>Guest blogging</li> <li>Online communities</li> <li>Forums</li> <li>Q&amp;A websites</li> <li>Native advertising platforms</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"success\">Measuring success</h2> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">There are a number of ways that you can measure the success of your content marketing campaign. These include:</p> <ul> <li>Website traffic</li> <li>Social media engagement</li> <li>Lead generation</li> <li>Conversions (Sales)</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"website-traffic\">Website traffic</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">One of the most basic indicators of content marketing success is website traffic. This can be measured in terms of the number of visitors to your website, the number of page views, or the amount of time spent on your site.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">To get a more detailed picture of which content is performing well, you can use Google Analytics to see which pieces of content are generating the most traffic. This will give you an idea of which content is being viewed the most and is, therefore, more popular with your audience.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">You can also use Google Analytics to track other metrics such as the average time spent on a page, the bounce rate, or the number of pages per session. These can all give you insights into how users are interacting with your content and whether they are finding it valuable.</p> <h3 id=\"social-media-engagement\">Social Media Engagement</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Another way to measure content marketing success is through social media engagement. This can be tracked in a number of ways, including the number of likes, shares, and comments on a piece of content, as well as the reach (the number of people who have seen the content).</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Both Facebook and Twitter have their own native analytics platforms that can give you detailed insights into the performance of your content. You can also use third-party tools such as Hootsuite Insights or BuzzSumo to track social media engagement.</p> <h3 id=\"lead-generation\">Lead Generation</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">If your content marketing campaign is focused on generating leads, then you&#8217;ll want to track the number of leads that you&#8217;re able to generate. This can be done using a tool such as Google Analytics, which will allow you to track the number of conversions (leads) that you&#8217;re able to generate from your content.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">You can also use third-party lead generation tools such as LeadPages or Unbounce to track and measure the performance of your content in terms of lead generation.</p> <h3 id=\"conversions-sales\">Conversions (Sales)</h3> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">If your content marketing campaign is focused on generating sales, then you&#8217;ll want to track the number of sales that you&#8217;re able to generate. This can be done using a tool such as Google Analytics, which will allow you to track the number of conversions (sales) that you&#8217;re able to generate from your content.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">You can also use third-party sales tracking tools such as Salesforce or HubSpot Sales to track and measure the performance of your content in terms of sales.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">Content marketing is a basic, but essential, marketing tactic. It involves creating and sharing valuable content with your target audience in order to attract and retain customers. In order to get started with content marketing, you&#8217;ll need to develop a content strategy, create high-quality content, and promote it through social media and other channels.</p> <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">When creating an effective content marketing programme, there are a few things to remember. First, you&#8217;ll need to identify your target audience and what needs and wants they have. Once you know this, you can create content that is tailored to their needs and wants. Additionally, you&#8217;ll need to promote your content through social media and other channels in order to reach your target audience. Finally, you can measure the success of your content marketing campaign by tracking metrics such as website traffic, social media engagement, lead generation, and conversions.</p> <p id=\"d3ab914b-9e38-404b-aace-2aa983788d77\">If you would like to learn more about <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">content marketing strategy</a> please just drop us a line.</p> <h2 id=\"content-marketing-faqs\">Content Marketing FAQs</h2> <div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\"> <div class=\"rank-math-list \"> <div id=\"faq-question-1716046148000\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\"> <h5 class=\"rank-math-question \">What is the definition of content marketing?</h5> <div class=\"rank-math-answer \"> <p>Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach that focuses on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience.

It is the holistic approach to creating a unique identity and personality that sets your company apart from the competition. This identity is shaped by various elements such as visual design, messaging, customer experience, and even your company&#8217;s values and culture.</p> <p>A strong brand conveys a promise to consumers, invoking trust, loyalty, and emotional attachment. Whether it&#8217;s through a consistent colour scheme or a distinctive voice in your communications, every aspect of your brand should cohesively tell your story and convey your mission.</p> <h3 id=\"the-importance-of-positioning\">The Importance of Positioning</h3> <p>Positioning is the strategic process of establishing your brand in the mind of your target audience. It involves identifying and communicating the unique value your product or service offers compared to competitors. Effective positioning helps you carve out a distinctive place in the marketplace, making it easier for customers to choose you over others.</p> <p>Your positioning should highlight the specific needs or pain points your brand addresses and how it uniquely satisfies them. A well-articulated positioning strategy makes your brand memorable and dictates all subsequent marketing efforts.</p> <h2 id=\"why-branding-and-positioning-matters\">Why Branding and Positioning Matters</h2> <h3 id=\"1-building-brand-equity\">1. Building Brand Equity</h3> <p>Brand equity refers to the value your brand adds to your product or service. It&#8217;s built through positive consumer experiences and perceptions over time.

Differentiating from Competitors</h3> <p>In a crowded marketplace, differentiation is crucial. Branding and positioning are tools to differentiate your offerings from those of your competitors.

Defining Your Brand Identity</h3> <p>Your brand identity is the face of your business. It encompasses the visual elements like logo, colour scheme, and typography, as well as the tonal elements such as brand voice and messaging. Consistency is key; a well-defined identity helps create a cohesive and recognisable brand. This can be done in-house, or if you don&#8217;t have the resources or knowledge you could research and <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/digital-marketing-consultancy-how-to/\">appoint a strategic marketing consultancy</a>.</p> <h3 id=\"2-creating-a-brand-personality\">2. Creating a Brand Personality</h3> <p>Your brand personality is the human-like traits that your brand exhibits. Is your brand playful and fun, or is it more professional and serious? This personality should align with your target audience&#8217;s expectations and preferences, making your brand relatable and engaging. Creating a brand playbook at this point could be a useful exercise to articulate your identity and personality to internal staff and suppliers who provide <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/marketing-services/\" >marketing services</a> to your company.</p> <h3 id=\"3-crafting-a-compelling-brand-story\">3. Crafting a Compelling Brand Story</h3> <p>A compelling brand story captivates your audience and gives them a reason to care about your brand. It should articulate your brand&#8217;s mission, vision, and values, and explain why you do what you do. An authentic and well-told brand story can resonate deeply with consumers, fostering loyalty and trust.</p> <h2 id=\"effective-positioning-strategies\">Effective Positioning Strategies</h2> <h3 id=\"identifying-your-unique-selling-proposition-usp\">Identifying Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)</h3> <p>Your USP is the unique benefit that sets your product or service apart from competitors. Identifying your USP is critical for effective positioning. Ask yourself: What do you offer that no one else does, or what do you do better than anyone else?</p> <h3 id=\"conducting-competitor-analysis\">Conducting Competitor Analysis</h3> <p>Understanding your competitors is key to successful positioning. Conduct a thorough competitor analysis to identify their strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and threats in the marketplace. This analysis can inform your positioning strategy, helping you own a distinctive place in the market. Think about what emotion you could own in the customers&#8217; mind, for example when you think of:</p> <div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Positioning.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Positioning.jpg 640w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Brand_Positioning-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure><div> <ul> <li>Starbucks &#8211; <strong>Moments</strong> &#8211; Valued moments in time whether that be with friends or family.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>IKEA &#8211; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Hygge</strong></a> &#8211; That cosy, contented mood evoked by comfort and conviviality.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Nike &#8211; <strong>Individual Excellence</strong> &#8211; The slogan &#8216;Just do it&#8217; epitomises this positioning inspiring action and striving for your own excellence.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Volvo &#8211; <strong>Safety</strong> &#8211; Volvo has been obsessed with the word since the 1940s, so much so that they invented the three-point seat belt.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Coca-Cola &#8211; <strong>Happiness </strong>&#8211; Campaigns such as &#8216;The Holidays are Coming&#8217; outlines how they own the feeling of happiness and togetherness.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Apple &#8211; <strong>Simplicity</strong> &#8211; Everyone can be part of the technological future.</li> </ul> </div></div> <h3 id=\"targeting-the-right-market-segments\">Targeting the Right Market Segments</h3> <p>Effective positioning requires targeting the market segments that will most benefit from and appreciate your offerings.

Whether through social media, email campaigns, or in-person interactions, your messaging should be uniform across all touchpoints. This consistency strengthens brand recognition and trust. Again, make sure this is documented and circulated to anyone who is producing branded assets or creating IP for your company.</p> <h3 id=\"leveraging-multiple-touchpoints\">Leveraging Multiple Touchpoints</h3> <p>Your brand should be visible wherever your target audience is. Leverage multiple channels—social media, email, websites, print media, and physical events—to ensure that your brand message reaches your audience effectively and consistently.</p> <h3 id=\"measuring-and-optimizing-your-strategies\">Measuring and Optimising Your Strategies</h3> <p>To ensure the success of your branding and positioning efforts, continually measure and analyse their impact.

When approached and delivered correctly, mentoring can produce wide and long-lasting benefits to an organisation.</p> <p>The main rationale for undertaking a mentoring program is to see tangible business benefits and a return on investment. However, quantifying these benefits can be challenging. In this article, we explore the primary benefits of mentoring for businesses and how it can be a win-win for both individuals and organisations.</p> <h2>Talent Retention</h2> <p>One of the primary benefits of mentoring is that it creates deeper bonds within the organisation. Mentoring provides mentees with the support and guidance they need to succeed in developing their roles and careers. When mentees succeed within the organisational structure, they are less likely to leave to develop their careers elsewhere. This, in turn, reduces staff turnover, and the businesses can focus on developing from within rather than bringing in new faces that can have a destabilising effect at senior levels.</p> <p>According to a 2006 study by Garner, retention rates were higher for both mentees (22% more) and mentors (20% more) than for employees who did not participate in a mentoring program (<a href=\"https://mccarthymentoring.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McCarthy Mentoring</a> 2017).</p> <h2>Professional Development</h2> <p>Mentoring provides recipients with a unique opportunity to develop new skills, knowledge, and ways of being, as well as receive benevolent guidance and support in their career development. Those that engage with mentoring report better job satisfaction, and businesses with a successful program report improved performance. In fact, they also progress faster, &#8220;25% of employees who enrolled in a mentoring program had a salary-grade change, compared to only 5% of workers who did not participate&#8221; (McCarthy Mentoring 2017 &#8220;<a href=\"https://mccarthymentoring.com/why-mentoring-what-the-stats-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why mentoring: what the stats say</a>&#8220;).</p> <h2>Improved Productivity</h2> <p>The benefits of mentoring to business productivity are well-documented, and many Fortune 500 companies have already implemented successful mentoring programs. According to the Centre for Workplace Leadership, in 2016, &#8220;71% of Fortune 500 companies have mentoring programs&#8221; (McCarthy Mentoring 2017). This number has only increased in recent years, with 84% of Fortune 500 companies having a mentoring program last year, and 100% of Fortune 50 companies having one (Cantalupo, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2022/05/19/does-mentoring-still-matter-for-fortune-500-companies/?sh=38b6f9ff5d8c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes 2022</a>).</p> <h2>Improved Morale</h2> <p>Mentoring empowers employees with opportunities to connect, learn, and receive guidance from more experienced colleagues. This creates a more positive and supportive work environment as a whole, which benefits organisational morale. Both mentees and mentors report having a greater sense of engagement and job satisfaction.</p> <p>A study by Moving Ahead and Deloitte of 6,000 people across 40 organisations found that &#8220;87% of mentors and mentees feel empowered by their mentoring relationships and have developed greater confidence&#8221; (<a href=\"https://www.women-ahead.org/press/turning-the-dial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dimmock 2017</a>).</p> <h2>Improved Diversity in Leadership</h2> <p>Diversity, especially in leadership, is still an issue for many businesses. However, mentoring has been shown to be one of the most effective methods of improving diversity in companies. In fact, a recent study showed that it &#8220;boosted minority representation at the management level by 9% to 24%&#8221; and &#8220;also dramatically improved promotion and retention rates for minorities and women—15% to 38%&#8221; compared to non-mentored employees (Beheshti, Forbes 2019).</p> <p>In conclusion, mentoring provides numerous benefits to both individuals and organisations, however, the <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/organisational-context-for-mentoring-success/\" >organisational context</a> has a massive bearing on the degree of success. The benefits include talent retention, professional development, improved productivity, improved morale, and improved diversity in leadership.

The process is not difficult, but it does require some patience and basic tools. In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the entire process, from registering a domain name to launching your new website. So whether you want to rebuild your existing site or want to find out how to build a website from scratch, we have you covered.</p> <h3>Contents</h3> <ol> <li><a href=\"#build\" >Why build/rebuild a website in the first place?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#creating\" >What goes into creating a website</a></li> <li><a href=\"#how\" >How to build and launch your website</a></li> <li><a href=\"#tips\" >Website design tips</a></li> <li><a href=\"#maintaining\" >Maintaining your website over time</a></li> <li><a href=\"#conclusion\" >Conclusion</a></li> </ol> <h2 id=\"build\">Why build/rebuild a website in the first place?</h2> <p id=\"eb4bab7b-84a8-4e69-bd05-5b3f343e6784\">There are many reasons for wanting to rebuild or build a better website, but first, it can be helpful to examine why you want to undertake this project. Your motivations for wanting to build a better website will serve as a useful guide to the functionality as well as look and feel of the site you will ultimately build.</p> <p id=\"eb4bab7b-84a8-4e69-bd05-5b3f343e6784\">Build a bucket list of the objectives that a new website will help you achieve and the core &#8216;must have&#8217; functionality that it will need to deliver to achieve your objectives. Next, rank these by importance, inevitably there will be things that are outside of your budget to build, or &#8216;nice to have&#8217; elements that could fall into the second phase of development or be built if the budget allows.</p> <p id=\"eb4bab7b-84a8-4e69-bd05-5b3f343e6784\">Once you have examined the why of the build, you will be in a good position to consider whether a third-party service could be utilised instead of a build/rebuild and if most of your motivations are around refreshing your brand whether just a design refresh of your existing site might be a better option.</p> <p id=\"eb4bab7b-84a8-4e69-bd05-5b3f343e6784\">Ultimately a website is a powerful marketing and communication tool that can help you achieve many business goals. It can be used to build brand awareness, generate leads, or drive sales, but it is important to define what you want out of it, as this will help you avoid expensive mistakes of how you are going to build it.

Alternatively, you could utilise a design agency, hire freelancers, or a web development company depending on the complexity of your project. Which route you choose will depend on having a clear idea of what you want out of the website.</p> </div> <p class=\"rank-math-howto-duration\"><strong>Total Time:</strong> <span>30 days</span></p> <ul class=\"rank-math-steps \"> <li id=\"howto-step-1654004062894\" class=\"rank-math-step\"> <h3 class=\"rank-math-step-title \">1. Get a domain name and URL </h3> <div class=\"rank-math-step-content \"><p>The first step in creating a website is to choose a domain name. This is the name of your website (e.g., www.example.com) and will be used to identify your site on the internet.<br />Ideally, this should be your brand name, but in some cases, this isn&#8217;t possible to also decide which suffixes (e.g. .com, .co, .co.uk) are most relevant to your business. </p> <p>Also, consider buying all the suffixes that might be relevant to your business in the future as these can redirect to your main domain name until you are ready to use them.<br />Once you&#8217;ve chosen a domain name, you&#8217;ll need to register it with a domain name registrar. This is a company that will manage the reservation of your domain name and ensures that it&#8217;s available for you to use. </p> </div> </li> <li id=\"howto-step-1654004165233\" class=\"rank-math-step\"> <h3 class=\"rank-math-step-title \">2. Set up an email address to match your domain name</h3> <div class=\"rank-math-step-content \"><p>Setting up an email address to match your domain name is a key part of having a website. This will ensure that all communications related to your website(s) &#8211; such as inquiries or feedback &#8211; come directly to you, rather than through a third-party provider. You will also need an email address to set up an administrator account on many of the hosting and CMS platforms, so it makes sense to do it at this stage.</p> <p>There are many different providers that offer email services, but we recommend using <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/intl/en_uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Workspace</a> (formerly known as G Suite). For a small monthly fee per user, you&#8217;ll get access to all the features you need, including email, storage space, and a whole host of other office software in one package.</p> </div> </li> <li id=\"howto-step-1654004200052\" class=\"rank-math-step\"> <h3 class=\"rank-math-step-title \">3. Organise hosting</h3> <div class=\"rank-math-step-content \"><p>Once you&#8217;ve registered your domain name, you&#8217;ll need to set up a web hosting account. This is where your website&#8217;s files will be stored and accessed by visitors on the internet. There are many web hosting companies to choose from, so be sure to do your research and find one that offers the features and price that you&#8217;re looking for. </p> <p>It is a good idea to understand how big your existing site is (if you have one), and how much traffic it currently receives, as this will give you a guide to work out how much storage and bandwidth you&#8217;ll and will help you select the right provider for your needs. If you don&#8217;t already have a site, it is still worth estimating how big the site will be and how much traffic you need to receive. If you are working with a good <a href=\"https://smithfield.studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">development company</a>, they should be able to make recommendations on this.</p> </div> </li> <li id=\"howto-step-1654004235586\" class=\"rank-math-step\"> <h3 class=\"rank-math-step-title \">4. Designing your website</h3> <div class=\"rank-math-step-content \"><p>The next step to building a better website is to define what information you want to present on the site. To do this outline the key pages and their function (i.e. how do they help users? what information do they need? what do you want them to do after visiting a page?).</p> <p>Once this is completed for each page then decide how you will present all of this information within a logical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">taxonomy</a>. At this stage, it is useful to develop navigational elements which will help users find what they are looking for. One approach might be to use a card sort to see how people naturally categorize the information you want to present.<br />After this, you should be in a position to start looking at the layout for your site. This will involve deciding what pages will be included, as well as the elements such as headers, footers, and sidebars that will appear on each page. It is quite often useful to create a wireframe of at least the key pages at this stage so your team can visualise how each page will work.</p> <p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to choose a colour scheme and font for your website. Often this is relatively easy if you have <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">brand guidelines or a playbook</a>. If not, they should be based on the overall look and feel that you&#8217;re going for with your site, your partners or an in-house designer should be able to help here.</p> <p>Then, you&#8217;ll need to create all the assets that will be included in the website. For each page on the website create a text document together with associated assets such as photos, videos, and graphics that will be used. Make sure you get any sign-offs required at this stage to avoid lengthy delays and confusion. Creating these in advance of the build will save you a huge amount of time and money whether you are doing it yourself or engaging freelancers or agencies to help you.</p> </div> </li> <li id=\"howto-step-1654004321070\" class=\"rank-math-step\"> <h3 class=\"rank-math-step-title \">5. Build your website </h3> <div class=\"rank-math-step-content \"><p>Once you have a design for your website, it&#8217;s time to actually start to build a better website. There are many different ways to build a better website, but the most common is to use a content management system (CMS). A CMS is a software platform that allows you to create and manage your website&#8217;s content without having to write any code. <br />Alternatively, as we have already outlined you could use external help such as freelancers or agencies depending on the complexity of the project.</p> <p>Most simple builds are created on top of a website maker platform like Wix or Squarespace. However, if your build is more complex, CMS platforms such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress</a>, Joomla, and Drupal might be the best website builder. All of these have their strengths and weaknesses, so make sure your objectives are clear and your budget has already been set.<br />Once you&#8217;ve selected a CMS, you&#8217;ll need to install it on your web server. This can usually be done with just a few clicks through your web hosting company&#8217;s control panel. </p> <p>After your CMS is installed, you&#8217;ll need to choose a theme for your website. A theme is a pre-designed template that you can use to give your site a specific look and feel. There are thousands of themes available for each CMS, so be sure to take your time and find one that fits the style of your site. Tip &#8211; Prioritise page load speed and SEO over fancy animations and transitions.</p> <p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to add your website&#8217;s content. This can include text, images, videos, and anything else you want your visitors to see. Be sure to add new content regularly to keep your site fresh and engaging. </p> </div> </li> <li id=\"howto-step-1654004337289\" class=\"rank-math-step\"> <h3 class=\"rank-math-step-title \">6. Test your website </h3> <div class=\"rank-math-step-content \"><p>Finally, test, test test. This is a stage that often gets overlooked by first-time builders, but it will pay off dividends in the long run. Make sure all of the functionality of the site works on a variety of mobiles and desktops with different browsers. Also, check layouts are responsive and do not break.</p> <p>Lastly ensure your assets such as graphics, logos, photos, and videos are in the right place, and please check your copy. There are services you can use for this such as <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">usertesting.com</a>, but also make sure you do your own testing first.</p> </div> </li> <li id=\"howto-step-1654004363334\" class=\"rank-math-step\"> <h3 class=\"rank-math-step-title \">7. Launching your website </h3> <div class=\"rank-math-step-content \"><p>After you&#8217;ve added all of your website&#8217;s content and tested it, it&#8217;s time to publish it for the world to see. If you have a pre-existing site you will also need to consider your existing site and decide what you will do with the pages that have been ranking in search. Otherwise, launching simply means making your site live on the internet. <br />To do this, you&#8217;ll need to change your domain&#8217;s DNS settings to point to your web server. This can usually be done through your registrar&#8217;s control panel. Once your DNS settings have been updated, your website will be live and accessible to anyone on the internet. Job done!</p> <p>But not really, then you will need to make sure your site is indexed with all the major search engines and promoted. Use social media, email marketing, and other marketing channels to get the word out.</p> <p>Use Google Analytics or another analytics tool to track the traffic coming to your site. This will help you understand what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not, so you can make changes accordingly. If you have a pre-existing site it is worth considering this before launch and undertaking an SEO project to decide how you are going to migrate over to the new site.</p> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <p class=\"rank-math-howto-supply\"><strong>Supply:</strong> <ul><li>Domain name, email address,</li></ul></p> <p class=\"rank-math-howto-tools\"><strong>Tools:</strong> <ul><li>Content Management System, Web Hosting</li></ul></p> <p class=\"rank-math-howto-tools\"><strong>Materials:</strong> <span>Copy, Images, Videos, Graphics, and Logos</span></p> <h2 id=\"tips\">7 Website design tips</h2> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Web_Design.jpg\" alt=\"7 Website design tips\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Web_Design.jpg 1000w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Web_Design-300x169.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Web_Design-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure> <p id=\"eb4bab7b-84a8-4e69-bd05-5b3f343e6784\">Creating a beautiful website is easier than you think, by following these simple tips and you&#8217;ll be on your way to designing a site that looks great and packs a punch.</p> <ul> <li>Use professional photos: High-quality images make a big difference in the overall look of your site.

But there are limitations to doing everything yourself. If it is a more complex project, often it is more cost-effective to bring in a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">specialist service</a>, agency, or outside A first-time build is much easier than a rebuild as you will not have to consider how you migrate across to the new one.

We&#8217;ll help you to look at how to choose the right coach or mentor, and also examine three key areas you might want to investigate before starting a relationship. To start, let&#8217;s define coaching and mentoring so we can understand how these elements interact.</p> <p>Knowledge refers to the acquisition and understanding of something at a mental or theoretical level. In the context of coaching and mentoring, it can be considered the acquisition of knowledge on how to perform the function without practical experience. This could be acquired through books, courses, training, or events.</p> <p>Skills, on the other hand, refer to the practical application of acquired knowledge to successfully undertake a function, in this case, coaching and mentoring.</p> <p>Behaviours are a higher-level function, a collection of skills that relate to a person&#8217;s values, attitudes, and mindsets required for functioning competence in a role. In a coaching and mentoring environment, these are high-level attitudes, values, and mindsets attributed to effective practitioners.</p> <p>Your prospective coach or mentor should have a deep understanding of coaching and mentoring practices, including the differences between the two. Three areas of knowledge can be considered critical for success; &#8220;knowledge of processes/knowledge of how things happen/knowledge of where to get help&#8221; (<a href=\"https://www.wlv.ac.uk/media/departments/partnerships/documents/The-Coaching-and-Mentoring-Handbook-FINAL-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The University Coaching &amp; Mentoring Handbook- 2017</a>).</p> <nav><ol><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#how-to-choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor-the-knowledge-skills-and-behaviours-to-look-out-for\">How to choose the right coach or mentor </a><ol><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#the-knowledge-skills-and-behaviours-to-look-out-for\">The knowledge, skills, and behaviours to look out for</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#knowledge\">Knowledge</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#skills\">Skills </a><ol><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#communication-skills\">Communication Skills</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#relationship-skills\">Relationship Skills</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#business-skills\">Business Skills</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#behaviours\">Behaviours</a><ol><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#emotional-intelligence\">Emotional Intelligence</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#self-awareness\">Self-Awareness</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#self-development\">Self-Development</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#reflection-and-evaluation\">Reflection and Evaluation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#action-and-outcomes\">Action and Outcomes</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/choose-the-right-coach-or-mentor/#faqs\">FAQs</a></li></ol></li></ol></nav> <h2 id=\"knowledge\">Knowledge</h2> <p>Firstly, knowledge of the process is essential for effective practitioners. It grounds them in their practice, gives them the awareness to navigate the engagement effectively, and allows them to avoid issues later. It also helps build relationships that flourish and keep clients focused on delivering their goals. Knowledge of the process, models, and techniques involved affords an effective practitioner the ability to tailor their approach to you to get the most out of the engagement and impact for you.</p> <p>Secondly, the knowledge of how clients behave and gain insights and learn allows practitioners of coaching and mentoring to remain open, relaxed, and focused on their clients&#8217; issues. Understanding how clients can manifest change is crucial to effective practitioners as it allows them to objectively evaluate their practice and ongoing impact.</p> <p>Thirdly, knowing how and where to get different types of help is critical to effective coaches and mentors. Practitioners need to set and maintain healthy boundaries and be able to signpost to additional help and resources when the engagement has fallen out of the contracted engagement or their abilities. Membership of associations (such as the <a href=\"https://www.associationofbusinessmentors.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ABM</a>), and peer-to-peer groups can help with this, as also being part of a wider mentoring scheme.</p> <p>Subject matter knowledge (Role or Industry Experience) is also essential for mentoring. While some experts and coaches do not feel like they need &#8220;subject matter knowledge&#8221; of a client&#8217;s role or industry to be effective in their coaching, coachees perceive that &#8220;the coach has experience within my industry&#8221; is the third highest factor in what makes a good coach (<a href=\"https://www.employment-studies.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Institute for Employment Studies </a>et al.).</p> <p>In contrast, for mentoring, it is generally accepted that mentors need to have relevant experience that the mentee seeks to develop, and the mentor has &#8220;extensive&#8221; and more senior experience, which creates a natural emphasis or bias towards what the mentor thinks and believes.</p> <p>To work with an effective coach or mentor, you need to ensure that they have a base knowledge of coaching and mentoring theory. However, the acquisition of that knowledge shouldn&#8217;t stand in the way of them developing an active practice to understand what works for the individual and the practitioner. The path of coaching is very simple, falling into three steps: What do you want? What do you really want? What will you do now? However, it can take many years to achieve mastery of these deceptively simple steps.</p> <h2 id=\"skills\">Skills&nbsp;</h2> <p>In addition to knowledge, good coaches and mentors should have a wide range of skills. While there are many skills that contribute to their effectiveness, let&#8217;s focus on those generally accepted within the coaching and mentoring field.</p> <h3 id=\"communication-skills\">Communication Skills</h3> <p>Communication skills are a vital component of effective coaching and mentoring. Active listening, summarising, incisive questioning, reflective enquiry, and the ability to provide information and feedback when appropriate are all essential skills. Practitioners should be able to tailor and adjust their communication style to support the client and offer encouragement when needed. Reynolds outlines five key communication skill components of coaching, including focus, active replay, brain hacking, goaltending, and new and next (Marcia Reynolds &#8211; &#8220;<a href=\"https://covisioning.com/coach-the-person-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coach the Person, not the Problem</a>&#8221; Page 6).</p> <h3 id=\"relationship-skills\">Relationship Skills</h3> <p>Relationship skills are equally important. Effective coaches and mentors can form high-quality relationships with their clients. They are adept at creating and developing rapport, discovering and building on shared values, and managing relationships in a coaching and mentoring context. This includes setting and maintaining boundaries and being open to clients without adopting their issues and problems. Maintaining objectivity in the best interests of the client is crucial.</p> <h3 id=\"business-skills\">Business Skills</h3> <p>Business skills are also vital to effective coaching and mentoring. Coaches and mentors must have a base of business skills that can be deployed in the service of you, the client. These skills may include the ability to vet and recruit employees, understand and utilise financial reporting, and have a rudimentary understanding of the key functions within every business and how they contribute to a successful and profitable business. </p> <p>The coaching and mentoring handbook also highlights the importance of having a &#8220;knowledge of the context in which business operates&#8221;, a &#8220;range of experience and variety of workplace skills&#8221;, and being &#8220;business/professional savvy&#8221; as three skills of an effective coach/mentor (<a href=\"https://www.wlv.ac.uk/media/departments/partnerships/documents/The-Coaching-and-Mentoring-Handbook-FINAL-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The University Coaching &amp; Mentoring Handbook</a>).</p> <p>In addition to the above, when looking for a coach or mentor see whether they have the ability to be comfortable in the face of uncertainty, be flexible and adaptable, and be comfortable taking risks. Also check that they are committed to their own personal and professional development and be willing to continually learn, develop and refine their skills. These factors are all important to choose the right coach or mentor for your business needs.</p> <h2 id=\"behaviours\">Behaviours</h2> <p>As defined above, behaviours embody a range of skill sets and knowledge combined with values, attitudes, and mindsets required for functioning competence in coaching and mentoring. In this sense, the <a href=\"https://emccuk.org/Public/Accreditation/Competence_Framework.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EMCC’s competencies framework</a> can be a useful resource for anyone looking to find a coach or mentor. Also, Broadwell’s “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Four stages of competence”</a> (Broadwell 1973) play into adopting the combination of skills and knowledge to the point that it becomes instinctive behaviour. Here is a list of the key behaviours that you should look out for in a good coach or mentor.</p> <h3 id=\"emotional-intelligence\">Emotional Intelligence</h3> <p>“Showing up” &#8211; “facing into your thoughts, emotions and behaviours willingly, with curiosity and kindness” (Susan David, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.susandavid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emotional Intelligence</a>&#8221; Pages 11-13). Some emotions will be appropriate and valid, others can be “harmful distortions” which can impact the effectiveness of coaching and mentoring. “Stepping Out” is also an important element in emotional intelligence, to detach from these thoughts and emotions to gain perspective on what they are trying to teach us.&nbsp;</p> <p>By doing this we create “Frankl’s open, non-judgemental space between our feelings and how we respond to them”. “Walking your why&#8221; is also a very powerful element of emotional intelligence in the context of coaching and mentoring. It enables good practitioners to connect with their underlying values and motivations for undertaking this work to stay motivated to continue developing their practice and keep “showing up”. (David, <a href=\"https://www.susandavid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pages 11-13</a>).</p> <p>However, as a client, you must realise that a practitioner’s “business is to offer, to advise, to support, to facilitate, to help, to guide &#8211; and that’s all…” “&#8230; what happens outside of your mentor sessions” is “something beyond” their ”control” (Julie Starr, &#8220;<a href=\"https://learnstarr.com/courses/the-mentoring-manual-free-downloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Mentoring Manua</a>l&#8221; page 52).</p> <h3 id=\"self-awareness\">Self-Awareness</h3> <p>As part of emotional intelligence, coaches and mentors must be self-aware, and “notice and limit the influence of your ego” (Starr 52) to be effective. “Understanding Self” is also considered to be one of the EMCC’s core competencies, highlighting that awareness of practitioners&#8217; values, beliefs, and biases can “affect their practice and uses this self-awareness to manage their effectiveness in meeting the client’s, and where relevant, the sponsor’s objectives” (“EMCC Competencies” 2015). Look out for and be aware of a potential coach or mentor’s own self-awareness when you have an initial conversation with them.</p> <h3 id=\"self-development\">Self-Development</h3> <p>To find a good coach or mentor, ask them what they do to exhibit a commitment to developing as a person and improving their practice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Whether that be in the practical experience of coaching, Reynolds notes “There is a reason it takes hundreds of hours to earn a credential. So far, no one has invented a magic pill that lets people instantly master coaching ability. Practice is necessary” (Reynolds 37). This coupled with a curiosity for learning more about the practice is the bedrock of developing and becoming effective.</p> <p>In my practice, I have had periods of formal learning and then practice, taking what I have learned and ‘trying it on’ to see whether it fits my style and the needs of my clients. Through this, I have started to understand what works for me (especially with my neurodiversity), and how I can best serve each client.&nbsp;</p> <p>By doing this, I feel I am exposing myself to an ever-widening diversity of ideas on the subject and drawing on the ones that resonate with me. Much like David’s “Tiny Tweaks Principle,” I am slowly evolving my mindset, beliefs, and motivation to get better at the practice (David 134).</p> <h3 id=\"reflection-and-evaluation\">Reflection and Evaluation</h3> <p>Reflection is a very useful behaviour to cultivate in terms of mentoring and coaching. It has allowed me to do two things concerning my practice. Firstly, “stepping out” and writing about my experience and performance has allowed me to not take on any emotionally charged content without being adversely affected by it. Ask your prospective coach or mentor what they do in terms of reflection and how it is built into their practice to make sure you choose the right coach or mentor.</p> <h3 id=\"action-and-outcomes\">Action and Outcomes</h3> <p>During coaching or mentoring sessions, it is essential to be clear about the direction of the conversation and where it is heading. For a coach or mentor without behaviours that refocus their clients on their goals or outcomes is a concern. Conversations will inevitably wander and often become circular.</p> <p>By balancing the process of &#8220;peeling the onion&#8221; with the client&#8217;s desired outcomes, coaches and mentors can remain curious while focusing on helping their clients achieve their aims. It&#8217;s worth noting that your goals may change or be reframed as the sessions progress, but it is the behaviour of refocusing on outcomes that serves you best as a client. Ask your prospective coach or mentor what they do to ensure that the work they do remains focused on your goals or outcomes.</p> <p>Behaviours are the most important thing to asses when choosing the right coach or mentor. This is because they become ingrained at an unconscious level, a concept Broadwell refers to as &#8220;unconscious competence.&#8221; However, there are also dangers associated with this, as once behaviours become instinctive, they become unconscious and invisible, potentially leading to the development of unwelcome biases, assumptions, and judgements. Therefore, it is important to understand whether a coach or mentor reviews their own behaviours to ensure that any biases or assumptions that may have developed are identified and addressed.</p> <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p>In conclusion, coaching and mentoring can be incredibly <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/benefits-of-mentoring/\">beneficial for personal and business growth</a>. By working with a skilled and effective coach or mentor, individuals can gain knowledge, develop skills, and cultivate behaviours that can help them reach their goals and achieve success. </p> <p>Ultimately, investing in coaching or mentoring can be an investment in oneself, with the potential for significant returns in terms of both <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/how-can-mentoring-help-your-business-grow/\">personal development and your business&#8217;s growth</a>. Whether seeking to advance in a career, navigate a challenging situation, or simply grow and develop as a person, coaching and mentoring can be powerful tools for achieving success.</p> <h2 id=\"faqs\">FAQs</h2> <div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\"> <div class=\"rank-math-list \"> <div id=\"faq-question-1719241099262\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\"> <h5 class=\"rank-math-question \">What is the difference between coaching and mentoring?</h5> <div class=\"rank-math-answer \"> <p>Coaching is typically focused on specific goals and outcomes, with the coach providing guidance and support to help the client achieve those goals.

It involves paying close attention to what the coachee or mentee is trying to articulate, without imposing views or value judgments on the topic at hand.&nbsp;</p> <p>Active listening can also involve summarising what a client has said in their language to provide a mirror of their thoughts so that they can be examined in a fresh light.</p> <p>Follow-up questions can also be considered an element of active listening, which can be used to probe further or provide a shift of perspective for the client. Genuine curiosity can also be an element of active listening, following the path of the client&#8217;s thoughts to their logical ends.</p> <h2 id=\"empathy\">Empathy</h2> <p>Another critical communication skill for coaches and mentors is empathy. It involves the ability to understand and connect with the client&#8217;s feelings and experiences without any judgment.&nbsp;</p> <p>This helps build rapport and establish deeper relationships with clients, leading to more meaningful and productive conversations.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Nancy Kline notes, &#8220;Empathy is about being present in the moment with the person you are coaching or mentoring, listening deeply to what they are saying and to what they are not saying&#8221; (Nancy Kline, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.timetothink.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Time to Think</a>&#8220;, 113). It is crucial to pay attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues to get a full picture of what the client is trying to communicate.</p> <h2 id=\"clarity\">Clarity</h2> <p>In addition to active listening and empathy, clarity of communication is another essential skill for effective coaches and mentors. This involves being able to remain objective about the topics being discussed and distilling complex issues to their essence.&nbsp;</p> <p>Practitioners should select language that is direct, objective, and free of misinterpretation. Clear communication also involves avoiding jargon or technical language and pitching communication to the level of the client based on what the practitioner knows of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Kline notes, &#8220;Clarity is about being able to describe what you are thinking or feeling accurately&#8221; (Kline, &#8220;Time to Think&#8221;, 113). It helps to ensure that clients understand the conversation&#8217;s key points and the actions they need to take to achieve their goals.</p> <h2 id=\"questioning-skills\">Questioning Skills</h2> <p>As well as being a key aspect of active listening, effective questioning is often considered to be the bedrock of coaching and mentoring. However, it is important to note that there is a danger in becoming too focused on asking the &#8220;right&#8221; questions rather than truly paying attention to the client.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Marcia Reynolds notes, coaches can end up spending more time trying to remember their question script than actually engaging with the client.</p> <p>Instead, an effective coach or mentor should have the ability to reframe comments and observations into open questions, allowing the client to continue to think and talk aloud.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, it is important to be aware of one&#8217;s own values, biases, and judgments and adjust them before posing questions. The purpose of follow-up questions is not to steer the client to a conclusion but to provide an opportunity for them to continue to think and examine their thoughts.</p> <h2 id=\"feedback\">Feedback</h2> <p>Clear and constructive feedback is a critical element of communication for coaches and mentors. It is important to maintain boundaries and address harmful behaviours, but it is equally important to provide feedback in a supportive manner that does not feel like an attack on the client.</p> <p>An effective coach or mentor should be specific about the feedback they would like to offer, focusing on facts rather than using words like &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8221; which could make the conversation inflammatory.&nbsp;</p> <p>Additionally, remaining calm and objective while being direct about the issue is crucial. Sometimes, saying something positive before and after can help, but it shouldn&#8217;t be used if the client is likely to ignore the feedback itself.</p> <h2 id=\"nonverbal-skills\">Nonverbal Skills</h2> <p>While <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Albert Mehrabin</a>’s study of 37 female study participants back in 1967 was the source of the perpetuated myth that only 7% of communication is verbal (this thinking has been challenged since by Timothy Hegstrom (1979) and Ray Birdwistell who himself was criticised for his research).&nbsp;</p> <p>There doesn’t appear to be a modern-day researcher who has challenged and developed this type of research recently.</p> <p>Mehrabin himself published an update stating that “this and other equations regarding the relative importance of verbal and nonverbal messages were derived from experiments dealing with communications of feelings and attitudes (i.e., like-dislike). Unless a communicator is talking about their feelings or attitudes, these equations are not applicable “ (Mehrabian 1981).</p> <p>However, whatever the exact percentage of communication that is non-verbal, it is widely accepted that it is important for effective communication.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gesturing, body language, tone of voice and facial expressions all have their part to play in communicating effectively, more importantly helping others communicate more effectively and build a relationship of trust.</p> <p>This is critical when we consider that “our brains operate with a negativity bias, that causes us to register even innocent expressions more readily than neutral or positive” (Marcia Reynolds, &#8220;<a href=\"https://covisioning.com/coach-the-person-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coach the Person</a>&#8221; 178). “Mastery in coaching requires that you accept that you are a judgy, biassed person. To judge is human”.&nbsp;</p> <p>We must however “catch and release” these judgy non-verbal reactions before they “sabotage your coaching” (Reynolds 179). This is easier said than done, but we can always strive to be a “nonreactive thinking partner” (Reynolds 182).</p> <p>Being aware of what we communicate nonverbally is the starting point for this and echoing without investing in our clients&#8217; non-verbal dialogue can help us build and strengthen relationships.</p> <h2 id=\"adaptability\">Adaptability</h2> <p>Finally, it has been touched upon in other elements of effective communication but adaptability lies at the core of great communication.&nbsp;</p> <p>The ability and continued curiosity to try different styles of communication for the benefit of the client.&nbsp;</p> <p>As people learn very differently and respond to different styles, clients respond and engage differently with different forms of communication. Sometimes their preferences can be determined by the type of character they are, or by formal assessments (such as Insights Colours or a personality questionnaire).</p> <p>Whichever method is used, tailoring to the client&#8217;s needs should be the priority. For example, a practitioner will need to use different communication techniques to help a mentee who is introverted or shy to open up, or they may need to be more direct and authoritative with a mentee who is resistant to change. These techniques will develop and evolve with the engagement as they develop, gain insight and start improving their outcomes.</p> <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p>In summary, effective communication skills are essential for successful coaching and mentoring. By developing these communication skills, practitioners can create positive and productive coaching or mentoring relationships, leading to better outcomes for clients.</p>",

This is becoming even more prescient as competition gets stronger. Before you outline a content calendar or even write an article, take the time to understand them, their wants and needs, the things that they are struggling with what topics they need help with. Ensure you have a documented content marketing strategy that is based on audience insights so everyone in your team knows your audience well.</p> <h2 id=\"empathetic\">Be empathetic</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Given recent global events, and interest rates now reaching a 40-year high, it is important to understand how many people are struggling. We as marketers should be sensitive, and craft more empathetic content that genuinely connects with our audiences and serves them, rather than taking a business-centric approach. By being customer-centric focused you&#8217;ll make the most of your content and marketing budgets but also be authentic in your approach.</p> <h2 id=\"experience\">Focus on the content experience</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">For the rest of 2022, content marketers will need to <a href=\"https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/why-user-experience-is-key-to-digital-marketing-success\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">focus more on the customer experience</a> than ever before. With so much competition for customers&#8217; attention, businesses can&#8217;t afford to produce content and not present it in an easily digestible way. Most of us cannot compete with the user experiences of social media apps but as an industry, we need to up our game and start crafting content experiences that start to engage users more deeply.</p> <h2 id=\"purpose\">Make content with purpose</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">In an age where content is constantly being created and distributed everywhere, it&#8217;s more important than ever for content to have a purpose. By creating content with a <a href=\"https://the-cma.com/why-use-content-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">specific goal in mind</a>, you will have a better chance of being remembered, and of potential customers engaging with your brand.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Some of the most successful content marketers are those who understand the importance of creating content with a single purpose. When content is created with a clear goal in mind, it is more likely to be successful in achieving its business objectives as well as resonating with consumers.</p> <h2 id=\"intent\">Match intent with the right format, type, and angle</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Recognising and matching search intent with the right content is becoming the key to having a high-performing website. Consider the following options about the intent of the keyword searches you want to rank for:</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\"><strong>Format </strong>&#8211; Consider which format will be most useful for the user to consume this content in. For example, if someone has searched for &#8216;pancake recipes&#8217; a short form how-to video may be a better format to deliver this content than a 1,000-word blog post about the history of pancake making. This is a very obvious example but quite often format choice can be much more nuanced.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\"><strong>Type </strong>&#8211; Next, think about the type of content which will be most appropriate, again taking the pancake analogy, it would make sense to match a &#8216;how to make pancakes&#8217; search with a step by step &#8216;How to&#8217; article, rather than expect to rank your pancake pan product page for the same term.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\"><strong>Angle</strong> &#8211; This is the final step of matching and is where empathy and editorial experience plays a part. In essence, it is looking at the search term and thinking about the motivations and desires behind the term. Then reframing this into the selling point of the piece of content.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Taking the same example again, someone searching for &#8216;how to make pancakes&#8217;, clearly doesn&#8217;t know how to make them, or needs a refresher on how to make them. in this instance, they probably are in a rush and don&#8217;t want to dig out that recipe book that&#8217;s in the back of the cupboard, instead they have decided to use a search engine to make it easier.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Therefore, the content that actually needs to be created is &#8220;How to make pancakes easily&#8221;. This is the selling point of the content and the promise that the content will need to deliver.</p> <h2 id=\"count\">Appropriate topic word count</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">One of the most common content mistakes is writing too much or too little on a given topic. It&#8217;s important to find a balance between providing enough information to be helpful without overwhelming your reader.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Each topic will be different depending on the complexity of the subject matter and the intent of the search term that you intend to rank for. For many topics quite often schema markup will be appropriate to either summarise a complex topic or provide step-by-step directions on how to undertake a task.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">By making sure your content is appropriate for the topic, not obsessing about the word count, and utilising schema markup, you will give your content the best chance of ranking and being surfaced in rich snippets.</p> <h2 id=\"repurposed\">Make content that can be repurposed</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Content is expensive to create and market, but considering how content can and will be repurposed for different social networks and platforms is important to consider as part an effective content marketing strategy. Some content types and formats will naturally lend themselves to be repurposed, while others will be difficult if not impossible.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">For the rest of 2022, by making more <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/repurposing-content-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">content that can be repurposed</a>, you will make the most of your budget and make your content work harder for you.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">Also, considering what needs to be undertaken to repurpose in advance of creating or commissioning, will lead to greater efficiencies in production and social media management saving you money.</p> <h2 id=\"refresh\">Refresh and enrich your best performing content</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\"><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >Content marketing strategy </a>is not a &#8216;set it and forget it&#8217; exercise. To be successful you will need to continually review and update your content to ensure that it is fresh and relevant to your audience. This is especially true of your most popular content, as this is content that is likely to be linked to, shared repeatedly, and has your best ROI.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">It makes both financial and business sense to consider refreshing and enriching your best-performing content, rather than only focusing on new markets and topics. How much could a change in ranking position mean in terms of traffic or conversion?</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">To achieve a top 3 position could mean adding new images or videos, updating statistics and case studies, or even adding new content blocks or sections. All of these will help to keep your content feeling fresh, and improve user engagement as well as rankings.</p> <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">By following these 8 content marketing strategy tips, you can ensure that your content marketing strategy is in good shape for the year ahead. By taking a fresh approach to your content, you can reach new audiences, rank higher in search, and improve your bottom line.</p> <p id=\"6be78205-50d7-40a9-8464-9caaaa06f9d9\">What content marketing strategy tips would you add to this list?

But don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re here to help. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll discuss what digital marketing is, what you should look for in a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >digital marketing consultancy</a>, and how much you can expect to pay for digital marketing consulting services.</p> <p id=\"1d9aa206-6995-4343-86f7-d8122270b4f8\">Choosing the right one can be difficult, but don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re here to help! In this blog post, we&#8217;ll discuss what digital marketing is, what you should look for in a company, and how much you can expect to pay for digital marketing consulting services.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"#what\" >What is digital marketing consultancy?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#why\" >Why are they important to businesses?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#how\" >How do I hire a digital marketing consultancy?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#look\" >What you should look for in a digital marketing consultancy?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#pay\" >How much you can expect to pay?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#conclusion\" >Conclusion</a></li> </ul> <h2 id=\"what\">What is digital marketing consultancy?</h2> <p id=\"7563e41e-3397-434f-aae6-b3149293cb82\">A digital marketing consultancy is a company that helps guide its client through the digital landscape. They tend to provide higher-level digital marketing consultancy services to the client including strategy, planning, and resourcing solutions for a digital marketing programme. They are quite often brought in at the business strategy stage to help define and hone a marketing strategy. They can also provide a whole host of digital marketing services to businesses including; website design and development, search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, and production services.</p> <h4>Digital Marketing Agencies vs Digital Marketing Consultancies</h4> <p id=\"7cc4175e-497f-4a08-be28-b0189c3d6e1f\">The demarcation between agencies and consultancies in this field has become blurred. But essentially consultancies consult, meaning that they use their experience and subject knowledge to advise the client. Whereas agencies do; they do strategy, they do SEO, they do campaigns.</p> <p id=\"7cc4175e-497f-4a08-be28-b0189c3d6e1f\">That being said some consultancies implement as well as advise, and some agencies do provide some advisory services. The real difference is the approach in that agencies want to sell services and a consultancy wants to sell an engagement whatever that may entail.</p> <p id=\"7cc4175e-497f-4a08-be28-b0189c3d6e1f\">Another difference is who tends to bring in an agency or consultancy. Agencies usually sit under the remit of a CMO, whereas consultancies are usually engaged via a CEO or CFO. This is because quite often part of the engagement for a consultancy is to assess the performance of the marketing function as a whole, including any agencies that may be incumbent.</p> <h2 id=\"why\">Why are they important to businesses?</h2> <p id=\"0d2dcd3e-10b8-40e6-b169-28636f3a9047\">Digital marketing consultancies are becoming increasingly important as the role of marketing evolves. Businesses are demanding more flexibility in the way they market their products and services. This means that the tenures of CMOs are <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cmos-time-in-their-posts-continues-to-grow-shorter-11619692215\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">becoming shorter</a> (just 40 months) and partners such as agencies can be brought as the need arises. Often consultancies are brought in to bridge the gap between CMO posts, or even take over the ownership of the long-term strategy.</p> <h3>The key benefits of using a consultancy are:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Perspective</strong> &#8211; an objective and independent digital marketing perspective that is not influenced by any legacy activity or internal politics.</li> <li><strong>Agility</strong> &#8211; the ability to respond quickly to changing digital landscape and business needs.</li> <li><strong>Expertise</strong> &#8211; digital marketing is a vast and ever-changing landscape. Consultancies have the specialist skills and knowledge to help businesses stay ahead of the curve.</li> <li><strong>Independence</strong> &#8211; digital marketing consultancies are not aligned to any one digital solution, platform, agency, or partner which means they can provide unbiased advice.</li> <li><strong>Flexibility </strong>&#8211; digital marketing consultancies are often engaged on a project basis which gives businesses the flexibility to scale up or down as needed.</li> <li><strong>Time </strong>&#8211; As the saying goes time is money, by utilising their expertise they will be able to help you move faster, which in turn will save money.</li> <li><strong>Profitability</strong> &#8211; Any professional consultancy will make sure that they have linked their inputs to real-world outputs within your business and be able to demonstrate how the work they undertake will have positive ROI.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"how\">How do I hire a digital marketing consultancy?</h2> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">When choosing a digital marketing consultancy, first it is important, to be honest, and undertake a bit of introspection. Ask yourself why are you considering this route? And what does your business really need to achieve your goals? Maybe a consultancy is not the best solution for you, to find out check out <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/find-and-working-with-a-marketing-consultant/\" >how to find and work with a marketing consultancy</a>.</p> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">Once you have decided that this is the right route, follow our 5-step guide to hiring a marketing consultancy:</p> <h3 id=\"audit\">1. Audit your internal capabilities.</h3> <p id=\"23306574-347b-432b-a191-d68fd64ce433\">It is important before contacting consultancies to have a very clear idea of what you will continue doing in-house and what areas and services you need help with.</p> <p id=\"23306574-347b-432b-a191-d68fd64ce433\">For some businesses, a simple SWOT analysis will provide enough information to do this, but if you have a systemic business problem this may require more work. A consultancy will be able to help you with this as part of a discovery exercise, but be prepared to pay for this.</p> <p id=\"23306574-347b-432b-a191-d68fd64ce433\">Be prepared to articulate clearly this so that they have a good brief to respond to, and be honest about your weaknesses.</p> <h3 id=\"goals\">2. Set out your goals.</h3> <p id=\"4d49339b-fdca-4a6f-b7da-123b7f6f5ed4\">Be clear about your business model, how it works and what you need to change to be better.</p> <p id=\"4d49339b-fdca-4a6f-b7da-123b7f6f5ed4\">Articulate your current state of how you reach consumers, and how you attract and convert them into customers.</p> <p id=\"4d49339b-fdca-4a6f-b7da-123b7f6f5ed4\">A good consultancy will want to know your CPAs, conversion rates, average order values, LTV, and marketing budgets as a bare minimum. Also, express how you would like these numbers to change to fit your business plan over 12 months.</p> <p id=\"4d49339b-fdca-4a6f-b7da-123b7f6f5ed4\">It could be useful to split these goals into hard metrics such as sales or ROI, but don&#8217;t exclude goals that are harder to define like improvements in branding, messaging, or company culture.</p> <h3 id=\"briefing\">3. Briefing.</h3> <p id=\"36aed1ec-e301-4201-8b86-587459545d7e\">Once you have compiled all the information from the first two stages you will be in a position to start the briefing. To find companies to brief either search Google for consultancies in your area, utilise your personal network and get recommendations. Linkedin can be useful for finding digital marketing consultancy websites.</p> <p id=\"d1964bb5-e1b2-4602-8d64-b734aa41da89\">The briefing can be done informally via meetups, calls, or over coffee. However, if your business is larger might involve creating and sending an RFP. You can find many templates for this online, so either download this <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-write-an-rfp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">easy-to-follow one from Indeed</a> or <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drop us a line</a>.</p> <p id=\"d1964bb5-e1b2-4602-8d64-b734aa41da89\">In most cases, you will make contact with someone who does new business development at the consultancy, and after giving them a brief overview of the business send them the RFP.</p> <h3 id=\"vetting\">4. Vetting &amp; fit.</h3> <p id=\"a05a8bee-f928-4b72-abe1-e32f0e7c257b\">Once you have briefed everyone, allow everyone enough time to respond (do set a deadline). The easiest way to approach this is to have two rounds of vetting:</p> <p id=\"a05a8bee-f928-4b72-abe1-e32f0e7c257b\">The first one will exclude all the consultancies that either did not respond or completely miss understood the brief. Make sure you send them a quick note to say why they have been excluded from the process, this will save you time in the long run.</p> <p id=\"a05a8bee-f928-4b72-abe1-e32f0e7c257b\">Most consultancies that did respond will also want to present their service or solution, so make sure you block off enough time in advance to do this.</p> <p id=\"a05a8bee-f928-4b72-abe1-e32f0e7c257b\">The second phase of vetting should be a bit more considered. Work with just two other people in your team to assess each presentation. Give them the set of criteria to judge each proposal and ask them to judge each pitch by the goals and fit you laid out in steps 1 and 2.</p> <h3 id=\"decision\">5. Decision making.</h3> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">Once all the presentations and/or RFPs have been received and presented, you should be in a position to form a consensus based on the checklists you provided.</p> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">Don&#8217;t forget though you are running the process, so if there are comments you don&#8217;t agree with feel free to discount them.</p> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">At this point, you should have two or three options that have naturally risen to the top.</p> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">Next, you will need to find a way of making a decision based on cost and benefit. To do this you will need to compare pricing. This can be difficult as some proposals might be based on a fixed project cost and others on flexible day rates.</p> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">To get an &#8216;apples for apples&#8217; comparison it is important to estimate the flexible costs that you think you will need to deliver your goals. This may involve asking for a revised proposal based on your assumptions or estimating this yourself.</p> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">Once you have a meaningful pricing comparison together with your selection criteria, you are in a position to make a decision.</p> <p id=\"102d9876-4d93-402e-97bf-4244cd64cb15\">This can be very difficult too! If it is any consolation, almost all the RFPs I have been involved with in the past have been decided on intuition or gut feeling. Don&#8217;t forget if you end up with two great options to decide between, they are still good options so don&#8217;t worry. Quite often culture, and fit outweigh small additional costs.</p> <h2 id=\"look\">What you should look for in a digital marketing consultancy?</h2> <p id=\"0d2dcd3e-10b8-40e6-b169-28636f3a9047\">To make a good decision when appointing a digital consultancy, look out for:</p> <ul> <li>Consultancies that have a tight service fit your needs. If they have an extensive menu and you only need a few specialist services, maybe you are better off with another more aligned consultancy.</li> <li>Consultancies that can demonstrate that they understand your business. The business model, macro factors, and marketing mix.</li> <li>Companies that have a pricing structure that is clear and easy to understand. Be wary of consultancies that obfuscate costs, or try to sell a solution without understanding your needs.</li> <li>Signs that the consultancy is honest and transparent. Also that they will be solely focused and engaged in solving your specific business problems.</li> <li>References and case studies. This will help you determine whether they are legitimate and whether the projects they have undertaken are similar to yours.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"pay\">How much you can expect to pay?</h2> <p id=\"0d2dcd3e-10b8-40e6-b169-28636f3a9047\">The cost of digital marketing consulting services will vary depending on the size of your business, the scope of your project, the company&#8217;s experience, and much more. However, you can expect to pay anywhere from £1,000 to £20,000 per month depending on how many services you require.</p> <p id=\"0d2dcd3e-10b8-40e6-b169-28636f3a9047\">We suggest that you compare any quotes you receive against <a href=\"https://www.majorplayers.co.uk/salary-survey-2021/salary-benchmarking-tool/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Major Players handy benchmarking tool</a>, or take a look at the following chart from Statista which outlines the costs from different services in <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1231241/cost-digital-marketing-agency-services-uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">their own research from March 2021</a>:</p> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image-1.jpeg 700w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image-1-300x130.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure> <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"4a81fbe2-2fe1-4fa4-a24c-c7cd394a7047\">A digital marketing consultancy can be a great way to get expert advice and guidance on how to improve your digital marketing strategy.

Even after the pandemic, many companies have not yet embraced digital, or have tried to, and found the experience too overwhelming. With &#8220;<a href=\"http://xn--65%25%20of%20the%20worlds%20gdp%20is%20predicted%20to%20be%20digitized%20by%202022%20%28imf%2C%202020%29-ym70e/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">65% of the world’s GDP is predicted to be digitized by 2022 (IMF, 2020)</a>&#8220;, it should be a priority for companies that still haven&#8217;t done so.</p> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">If your company is one of these, don&#8217;t fret, you&#8217;re not alone, in fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/870924/worldwide-digital-transformation-market-size/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a>, &#8220;spending on digital transformation technologies and services worldwide is predicted to increase from $1.8 this year to $2.8m by 2025, indicating that there are many companies in the same position.</p> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">In reality, the process can also be streamlined and even enjoyable, especially if you work with a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">partner</a>. In the following article, we will outline the five key steps you need to undertake to deliver a successful digital transformation:</p> <ol> <li><a href=\"#stakeholders\">Identify the right stakeholders</a></li> <li><a href=\"#strategy\" >Develop a clear vision and strategy</a></li> <li><a href=\"#culture\" >Establish a culture of change and empower staff</a></li> <li><a href=\"#roadmap\" >Build a roadmap to transformation</a></li> <li><a href=\"#learning\" >Operate transformation based on validated learning</a></li> <li><a href=\"#Conclusion\" >Conclusion</a></li> </ol> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">Let&#8217;s take a closer look at each of these steps.</p> <h2>1. Identify the right stakeholders</h2> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">The first step is to identify the right stakeholders. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the success or failure of the digital transformation initiative. To identify the right stakeholders, it&#8217;s important to consider who will be affected by the digital transformation and who stands to gain or lose the most from its success or failure. Once you&#8217;ve identified the stakeholders, it&#8217;s important to engage them in the digital transformation process from the outset and ensure that they understand the goals and objectives of the initiative.</p> <h2 id=\"strategy\">2. Develop a clear vision and strategy</h2> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">The second step is to develop a clear vision and <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strategy</a>. The vision should be a long-term, aspirational goal that the organization wants to achieve through digital transformation. The strategy, on the other hand, is the plan of action that will be taken to achieve the vision. When developing a strategy, it&#8217;s important to consider the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>The current state of the organization and where it wants to be in the future</li> <li>The specific goals and objectives that the digital transformation should achieve</li> <li>The resources that will be required to support the process</li> <li>The timeline for implementing the process</li> <li>The risks and challenges associated with this</li> <li>The budget available to undertake the transformation</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"culture\">3. Establish a culture of change and empower staff</h2> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">The third step is to establish a culture of change and empower staff. To successfully do this, it&#8217;s important to create a culture within the organization that is supportive of the change. This can be done by communicating the goals and objectives of the transformation initiative to all employees and ensuring that they understand how it will impact their roles. </p> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">Additionally, it&#8217;s important to provide employees with the training and tools they need to effectively support the process. Furthermore, your staff need to be empowered to make their own decisions and have the latitude to make changes that will improve the way things work. Be aware that you will need to keep communicating this to staff throughout the process and beyond.</p> <h2 id=\"roadmap\">4. Build a roadmap to transformation</h2> <p id=\"d88a31a1-07af-4d2d-b7cd-ade8282b35ca\">The fourth step is to build a roadmap to transformation. The roadmap should be a detailed plan that outlines the specific steps that need to be taken to achieve the digital transformation. When creating the roadmap, it&#8217;s important to include the following factors:</p> <ul> <li>The current state and capabilities of the organization and where it wants to be in the future</li> <li>The specific goals and objectives of the digital transformation</li> <li>The resources that will be required</li> <li>The timeline for implementing the process</li> <li>The risks and challenges associated with the process</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"learning\">5.

And what does it mean?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#stages\" >What are the stages of the customer journey?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#start\" >Start with the customer and their needs</a></li> <li><a href=\"#how\" >How to map the customer journey</a></li> <li><a href=\"#importance\" >Why is it important</a></li> </ul> <h2 id=\"what\">Customer Journey Definition</h2> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">A customer journey is the series of interactions a customer has with a brand, product, or service. It includes all touchpoints, both direct (like contacting customer service) and indirect (such as hearing about the brand at an event). Customer journey mapping involves documenting and analysing these steps to understand and enhance customer experiences.</p> <h3>Customer Journey Types</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">There are three types: Basic, Complex, and Transactional, each varying in complexity and decision-making:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>Basic Customer Journey</strong> is the journey that the majority of customers take. It is the simplest and most common type of customer journey. </li> <li>The <strong>Complex Customer Journey</strong> is the journey that a minority of customers take. It is more complex because the customer has to overcome more obstacles or make more decisions.</li> <li>The <strong>Transactional Customer Journey</strong> is the journey a customer takes when making a purchase.</li> </ul> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">But as channels have proliferated and customers&#8217; needs have evolved into a complex system of interactions, it is best to consider these types of journeys as archetypes, rather than true to life.</p> <h2 id=\"stages\">What are the stages of the journey?</h2> <p id=\"0dc65181-ccbc-4143-a3d3-77ccc086ab24\">There are many ways of defining this, and we have developed <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">our own methodology for customer journey mapping</a> designed for direct-to-consumer brands. However, it is generally accepted that there are four main stages of mapping:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The Awareness stage</strong> is the stage where the customer becomes aware of the problem they need to solve or the opportunity they need to take advantage of.</li> <li><strong>The Consideration stage</strong> is the stage where the customer starts researching solutions to their problem or opportunity.</li> <li><strong>The Purchase stage</strong> is the stage where the customer buys the product or service.</li> <li><strong>The Loyalty stage</strong> is the stage where the customer becomes a repeat customer or a brand advocate.</li> </ul> <p id=\"83b08418-2b6b-485e-a057-f6a0fb308b5b\">A quick Google search will reveal thousands of styles of different customer journey mapping stages and templates, but if you are just starting HubSpot has <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-journey-map-template\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">7 simple user journey map templates</a> that you can download for free to get started. user</p> <h2 id=\"start\">Start with the customer and their needs</h2> <p id=\"22886fef-d698-4545-8ae3-fb3cf13eff4a\">Before starting to understand the journey itself, it is really important to immerse yourself in the world of your customers and view your product or service through their lens. The first thing to look at when doing this, is their needs and motivations, as this is what drives consumer behaviour. Here are some types of needs to consider:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Functional Needs</strong> are the needs that the customer has to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.</li> <li><strong>Social Needs</strong> are the needs that the customer has to interact with other people.</li> <li><strong>Emotional Needs</strong> are the needs that the customer has to feel a certain way.</li> <li><strong>Experiential Needs</strong> are the needs that the customer has to have a certain experience.</li> </ul> <p id=\"ba61786b-2d2f-4869-9912-e728e856debf\">It is essential to understand these needs as they related to different customers or personas before embarking on a customer journey mapping exercise.</p> <h2 id=\"how\">How to map the customer journey</h2> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Here are the 10 main steps that we undertake as part of a customer journey mapping project:</p> <ol> <li><a href=\"#define\" >Define your goals</a></li> <li><a href=\"#start\" >Start with personas and jobs</a></li> <li><a href=\"#list\" >List all current touchpoints</a></li> <li><a href=\"#journey\" >Define the customer journey</a></li> <li><a href=\"#journey\" >Review your journeys and critique them</a></li> <li><a href=\"#resource\" >Highlight areas where too much resource is committed</a></li> <li><a href=\"#value\" >Highlight areas where value can be added</a></li> <li><a href=\"#current\" >Create a current state map</a></li> <li><a href=\"#future\" >Create a future state map</a></li> <li><a href=\"#use\" >Use and review maps regularly</a></li> </ol> <h3 id=\"define\">1. Define your goals</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The first step is to define your goals and examine them. What do you want to achieve with the customer journey map? What business problem are you hoping to solve? Is this the right approach for that problem?</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">There are many other <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strategic frameworks </a>out there, and maybe they are more practical for solving your current issues. Before moving on to the next step it is also useful to consider who you want to take on the journey, which stakeholders will give the greatest insight, and which will lead the project towards actionable change.</p> <h3 id=\"start\">2. Start with personas and jobs</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The second step is to refer back to the customer research that you have undertaken earlier. At this point for each <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2016/3/17/the-difference-between-customer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">customer type or persona</a>, you should have a list of the types of needs they have as well as the jobs or goals they are trying to achieve. Also, consider the pain points that they will reach certain parts of the consumer journey.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">It is worthwhile at this stage to think about whether your business is satisfying the wrong needs or even whether the job your service or product solves is even relevant at all. Quite often at this stage, it will highlight areas of your product roadmap that are out of sync with your customers.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Next, consider the stages they will go through when trying to solve their problem or achieve their goal.</p> <p>Ask your team:</p> <ul> <li>What is the most important job this persona is looking for help with?</li> <li>Are all the steps needed?</li> <li>Could your business disrupt these steps to provide a better service?</li> <li>Are we speaking to this persona at the right time, through the right channels?</li> </ul> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">It can be helpful at this stage to create a persona template that you can use to map out the different characteristics of your persona. HubSpot also has a useful <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tool for creating personas</a>.</p> <h3 id=\"list\">3. List all current touchpoints</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The third step is to list out all the current <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/mp/identify-customer-touchpoints/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">touchpoints</a> that the customer has with your brand. This includes both digital and physical touchpoints.</p> <p><strong>What is a customer journey touchpoint?</strong></p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">A touchpoint is any interaction the customer has with your brand. This could be the first time they see an advert, the moment they land on your website, the point of sale, or even a post-purchase follow-up call or email. It is important to consider all the touchpoints in the journey as this will help you understand how customers interact with your brand and where the biggest opportunities or pain points are.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">To do this, you will need to consider the customer journey from the persona&#8217;s perspective and understand how they interact with your brand at each stage.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">It is helpful just to list every single touchpoint and not examine them at this point, as you will likely find that you have many more touchpoints than you initially thought</p> <h3 id=\"journey\">4. Define the customer journey</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The next step is to define the user journey map for each of your personas. This will involve creating a separate customer journey map for each persona, detailing their individual jobs, needs, and pains, as well as defining the stages they typically go through that leads to a purchase.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Focus on getting a basic Journey down first, before considering optimal or broken journeys.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The easiest way to do this is with sticky notes, or a <a href=\"https://miro.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">virtual whiteboard</a> if your team is working remotely.</p> <h3 id=\"review\">5. Review your journeys and critique them</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Then it is time to review your current state user journey map and critique them through the lens of value. Understand if and where your business currently adds value in the journey.</p> <p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Ask your team the following questions:</p> <ul> <li>What value are you providing the customer at each stage of the consumer&#8217;s journey?</li> <li>How could you improve this?</li> <li>Are there any areas where you are not providing enough value or where the customer may be getting frustrated?</li> <li>How are you addressing their pains?</li> <li>Are there stages that could be removed or simplified?</li> <li>Is there a bigger job you could solve that would create more value?</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"resource\">6. Highlight areas where too much resource is committed</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Now that you know what your customers want and the ways they tend to interact with your business, it is time to optimise the customer journey to serve their needs.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">This could mean removing lengthy call times or multiple emails back and forth. Or cutting areas from your marketing spend. Identifying these areas can help you to streamline the journey, improve the customer experience, and make your business more profitable.</p> <h3 id=\"value\">7. Highlight areas where value can be added</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">This could be anything from adding a live chat function to your website to providing more helpful information at key points in the journey, or marketing via a channel that has not been used to date. It also might mean creating informative content or building a helpful tool for your customers.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Ultimately, it might involve evolving your product or creating a new one to take advantage of a new opportunity.</p> <h3 id=\"current\">8. Create a current state map</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The next stage is to create a current state map, or user experience map of how your business services now. Make sure that this is visual and easy to understand so that everyone in your business can refer to it and more importantly use it. This will help you to understand where your consumer journey currently sits at a given point in time.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">It is also useful to refer back to this type of map later so that you can chart your business&#8217; progress and development.</p> <h3 id=\"future\">9. Create a future state map</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The penultimate step is to create a future state map of how it could work by creating more value to customers. This will involve brainstorming new and innovative ways to improve the customer experience and adding value at every stage of the journey. The insights that you have already generated will be useful here.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Once you have a list of potential improvements, get your team to rank them by considering how helpful these are to each persona in achieving their goal, or undertaking their job.</p> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">As with the current state map then create a visual map of this journey including only the top five innovations as agreed by the whole team.</p> <h3 id=\"use\">10. Make sure these maps are used and reviewed regularly</h3> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">Finally, make sure that these maps are used and reviewed regularly. They should be living documents that are constantly updated as the customer journey evolves. Reviewing the maps regularly will help you to identify any new opportunities or areas for improvement and highlight new jobs that your company could solve.</p> <figure><div> <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How To Make An Effective Customer Journey Map In 1 Hour (FREE Templates)\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/68ZXwI5L4kY?start=375&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div></figure> <h2 id=\"importance\">Why is it important?</h2> <p id=\"503ac504-6119-4db0-848e-2a013a690767\">The customer journey is important because it helps you service your existing customers well, and hopefully better than your competitors.

It depicts the various touchpoints and interactions a customer encounters throughout their journey, from initial awareness to post-purchase support and advocacy. By mapping out this journey, businesses can gain insights into customer behaviour, pain points, and opportunities for improvement.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"faq-question-1716194715077\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\"> <h5 class=\"rank-math-question \">Why is creating a customer journey map crucial for businesses?</h5> <div class=\"rank-math-answer \"> <p>Developing a customer journey map is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it helps companies understand their customers&#8217; perspectives, motivations, and expectations at each stage of their interaction. This understanding enables businesses to identify areas where the customer experience may be lacking or where additional support or resources are needed. Secondly, a well-crafted customer journey map facilitates cross-functional collaboration within an organisation, ensuring that all departments are aligned in delivering a consistent and seamless experience. Additionally, it serves as a powerful tool for identifying opportunities for i<a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >nnovation</a>, streamlining processes, and optimising customer touchpoints.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"faq-question-1716194756957\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\"> <h5 class=\"rank-math-question \">What are the typical stages included in a customer journey map?</h5> <div class=\"rank-math-answer \"> <p>While customer journey maps can vary depending on the industry and specific business, they typically include the following stages: Awareness (initial discovery of the product or service), Consideration (researching and evaluating options), Purchase (the decision-making and transactional phase), Experience (using the product or service), and Loyalty (post-purchase support, advocacy, and potential repurchase). Each stage encompasses various touchpoints, such as website visits, social media interactions, customer service interactions, and product usage experiences.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"faq-question-1716194773213\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\"> <h5 class=\"rank-math-question \">How can businesses gather data to create an accurate customer journey map?</h5> <div class=\"rank-math-answer \"> <p>To create an accurate and insightful customer journey map, businesses should leverage a combination of data sources and research methods. This may include website analytics, customer feedback surveys, social media monitoring, customer interviews, focus groups, and observation of customer interactions. Additionally, businesses can leverage internal data from various departments, such as sales, customer service, and marketing, to gain a comprehensive <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" >understanding of customer touchpoints and pain points</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"faq-question-1716194811964\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\"> <h5 class=\"rank-math-question \">How can a customer journey map be utilised to improve the overall customer experience?</h5> <div class=\"rank-math-answer \"> <p>A well-designed customer journey map serves as a powerful tool for improving the overall customer experience in several ways.

You&#8217;re responsible for marketing your company, generating leads, selling products or services, and handling customer service &#8211; just to name a few things. It&#8217;s no wonder that so many founders of direct-to-consumer businesses feel overwhelmed and stressed out.</p> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">One way to take some of the pressure off is to hire a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >marketing consultant</a>, which allows you to focus on growing your business rather than building your marketing function. The benefits of working with an independent practitioner are access to specialist marketing skills and knowledge, fresh ideas and perspectives, an objective viewpoint, additional capacity, and bandwidth. Over time a good independent consultant should be able to help you build your knowledge and a marketing function in-house.</p> <h2>Contents</h2> <ol> <li><a href=\"#what\" >What do they do?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#grow\" >How can they help your business grow?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#benefits\" >What are the benefits to your business?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#find\" >How to find and work with one</a></li> <li><a href=\"#thoughts\" >Closing Thoughts</a></li> </ol> <h2>What is a marketing consultant? And what do they do?</h2> <p id=\"what\">They are independent professionals who will come into your business on a temporary or part-time basis to grow your marketing function. They offer specialist marketing skills and knowledge, as well as fresh ideas and perspectives. They can help businesses to create and execute their marketing plan more effectively and can provide guidance and support throughout the process. As experts in their field, are also able to refine your value proposition and deliver you a cost-effective go-to-market strategy for your business.</p> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">They will usually start by auditing your customers, business, and any marketing that has been done to date, before formulating a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >strategic direction based on your business plan</a>, followed by a marketing plan. They can often help you with executing that plan, whether that be with in-house staff or freelancers from their network.</p> <h2 id=\"grow\">How can they help your business grow?</h2> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-300x200.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-768x512.jpg 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Marketing_Consulting.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">Marketing consultants can help your business grow by providing a fresh perspective on your marketing, and offering innovative directions, or technical solutions that you might not have thought about. They can also help you to execute your marketing plan more effectively, and provide guidance and support on how to streamline the process and make the most out of your budget. </p> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">With their extensive experience, they should be able to make sure that you have a good product-market fit and make sure that your business objectives are underpinned by the correct level of marketing support. They should also be able to help you find new customer segments that maybe you have never considered, and help you understand which customers are profitable and therefore who to focus your marketing on.</p> <h2 id=\"benefits\">What are the benefits to your business?</h2> <h3>Perspective</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">The key advantage of working with a freelance marketing consultant is that they are annexed to your business and should give you an honest appraisal of where opportunities might lie, as well as highlight the shortcomings at a strategic and tactical level. Very few employees and even fewer agencies will feel comfortable giving this type of feedback. They will also be much more familiar with the marketing and consumer trends as well as the consumer research that is available.</p> <h3>Diagnosing Problems</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">A good consultant should have enough practical experience to give you absolute clarity on what is working and what is not, furthermore what you need to do to fix things. From broken campaigns, teams, conversion funnels, or communication, good practitioners should have a wide breadth of knowledge of the whole marketing function to be able to diagnose and fix all marketing-related problems often saving you huge amounts of money in the process.</p> <h3>Capacity</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">A consultant is a great option if your company is growing, you are strapped for resources, or you have been unable to hire anyone of the right calibre in-house. They should be able to help plug the gaps in more senior functions such as strategy development and budgeting, but also help you move more quickly by implementing a marketing plan. Many will also be able to make introductions to key personnel you need to hire or even build virtual teams on your behalf.</p> <h3>Accountability</h3> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">Most practitioners have previously been in senior marketing in-house roles, so they should more than comfortable with assuming responsibility within your organization. They will be adept at delivering complex marketing plans and keeping your staff and third-party suppliers and agencies on track. They should be a safe pair of hands that you can rely on, but also flag issues with delivery whether that be inside or outside your organization. A surprising benefit of using an independent consultant is that they may even keep you more accountable!</p> <h2 id=\"find\">How to find and work with a consultant</h2> <p id=\"d302f0fd-a8be-4c94-853b-cff7a5bf3298\">n today’s fast-paced business environment, bringing in a consultant can be a game-changer.

With consumers also feeling the pinch and spending less, it is no wonder that business owners are starting to feel concerned that there is a recession on the way. But while many businesses are focusing on ways to save money, there are still opportunities for those who know how to take advantage of them. One such opportunity is <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">direct marketing</a>.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Many studies including the Harvard Business Review have found that direct marketing in a recession is a good thing, and <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-to-market-in-a-downturn-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slashing all marketing in a recession is a mistake</a>. However, the companies that refocus their budgets and efforts on measurable forms of marketing like direct marketing, weather the economic storm better, build market share and flourish after a recession. Building and maintaining strong brands also remains to this day the best way of weathering an economic downturn.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">In this article, we will discuss why it is so important to continue direct marketing in a recession, how to it is an effective way of beating a downturn, and why direct marketing is the best method of doing this.</p> <ol> <li>What direct marketing is</li> <li>The benefits of direct marketing over traditional methods</li> <li>How to direct market in a downturn</li> <li>Tips for creating a direct marketing campaign that works</li> </ol> <h2>1. What direct marketing is</h2> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Direct marketing is a form of marketing that involves direct communication with potential customers. This can be done in a variety of ways, including postal mail, email, phone calls, SMS, and advertising. It is a way of marketing that allows businesses to target specific consumers based on their interests, which can result in higher conversion rates.</p> <h2>2. The benefits of direct marketing over traditional methods</h2> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">There are many benefits to direct marketing over traditional methods, particularly in a recession. One of the main benefits is that it is more cost-effective. By cutting out the middleman, businesses can save money on advertising costs and pass those savings along to the consumer.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Another benefit of direct marketing is that it is more targeted and offers measurable returns. Businesses can target specific consumers based on their interests, which can result in higher conversion rates. Additionally, direct marketing allows businesses to track results and ROI more effectively, making it easier to adjust and improve campaigns incrementally.</p> <h2>3. How to direct market in a downturn</h2> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Now that we&#8217;ve covered the basics of direct marketing and some of the benefits it offers, let&#8217;s take a look at how direct marketing works in a downturn.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">One of the most important things to remember when direct marketing in a recession or downturn is to understand the psychology behind economics. It is also crucial to adopt a consumer-focused mindset.</p> <h3>Downturn Psychology</h3> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Each recession is unique with different factors contributing to the downturn. The recession of 2009 was driven by banking practices and bad debt, The Great Depression on the other hand was a fragile post-war economy, speculation, and mistakes made by the US Federal Bank. These factors will impact consumers very differently and will determine in part their mindset as well as how they behave.</p> <h3>How does consumer spending change during a recession?</h3> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Consumers no matter how affluent, tend to categorise their expenditure in the following way:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Essentials</strong> &#8211; These are the items that consumers cannot go without such as food, water, shelter, and clothing.</li> <li><strong>Discretionary</strong> &#8211; These are the items that consumers do not necessarily need but make their life more comfortable. These include items such as entertainment, eating out, holidays, and new clothes.</li> <li><strong>Deferred</strong> &#8211; These are the items that consumers may want but due to the current circumstances, they are not able or willing to purchase them. These include big-ticket items such as a new car or home improvements.</li> <li><strong>Expendables</strong> &#8211; These items are neither essential nor discretionary for living a full life, and are the first things to be cut when consumers are feeling the pinch. These include items such as luxury goods, eating out, and subscriptions.</li> </ul> <p id=\"9e1417f9-a1c9-4027-a220-d54c98788bfd\">To succeed with direct marketing in a recession, it is crucial to understand which of these categories your service or product sits in and formulate a recession strategy based on how consumers will treat spending in your vertical.</p> <p id=\"9e1417f9-a1c9-4027-a220-d54c98788bfd\">For example, if you are a luxury goods manufacturer you may need to consider new markets where the downturn has had less of an impact or economies that have not been impacted at all. Or, if you sell a discretionary product, you may change your messaging to suggest that your product is a little luxury that makes life worth living.</p> <p id=\"9e1417f9-a1c9-4027-a220-d54c98788bfd\">Wherever your product or service falls in consumers spending priorities, acknowledge it and plan according, even if the means slashing budgets early. Whether or not you have products in demand during recession there will be a strategy that works for you.</p> <h3>Portfolio Audit</h3> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">If you have more than one product it is really important to perform a portfolio audit to understand which of your products and services has the highest cost base, profit-based, as well as long-term market potential.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">This is where potentially hard decisions need to be made. It may be that you have a new launch product that everyone is behind, but it doesn&#8217;t have long-term growth potential and in the short term it is going to be a big drain on your resources. Sometimes closing this type of enterprise might be the right decision, or just servicing existing customers might be viable.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">This will depend on your own business and circumstances. Only you will know the right thing to do.</p> <h3>Opportunites</h3> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Next it is time to look at the positive and discover the opportunities that sit within your portfolio of products or services. If you only have one this is still a useful exercise to undertake.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">For each product, of service sketch out a <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">business model canvas</a> and then decide how things could be done differently. Ask yourself the following questions:</p> <ul> <li>Could we generate recurring revenues by converting products into services?</li> <li>Could we better integrate our products or services?</li> <li>Are there additional customer needs we could satisfy?</li> <li>Could we add extensions to our Value Proposition?</li> <li>There are other jobs could we do on behalf of consumers?</li> <li>Can we replace one-time transactions with recurring revenues?</li> <li>Are there other elements that customers be willing to pay for?</li> <li>Could we standardise or cut some of our Key Activities?</li> <li>We can benefit from a growing market?</li> <li>Could channel efficiency or effectiveness could be improved?</li> <li>Could we use less costly resources to achieve the same result?</li> </ul> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Once complete you should have a list of key opportunities that you can then rank by the impact that they will have on your business.</p> <h3>Recession marketing strategy</h3> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Now that you have all the information together it is time to formulate a recession-beating strategy. First focus on your portfolio and in light of all the work that you have done, be honest about your prospects.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Better to discontinue some product lines now and thrive, than have your whole company brought down by the products or services that clearly will not weather the storm.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Next, consider where you can place your investment in marketing. Take scalpel to the rest of your budget and work out the bare minimum you need to spend on things like communications, display media, and any long-term branding projects that are underway.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">To counteract this also consider how and if you can discount your product. Consumers in a recession do appreciate value, so ensure that your offering does represent good, or better value than before.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Then once this is done consider whether based on your existing metrics how much of this could or should be reallocated to your direct marketing budget.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Refer back to your consumer psychology and opportunities and start to formulate some hypotheses of direct marketing strategies you could undertake to increase sales.</p> <p id=\"179d7ee5-8ce3-4261-822f-469ca293b2d1\">Finally, formalise the budgets for this activity and ringfence it for the long term, there is nothing worse than pulling more spending later, only to discover that if you had continued for another couple of months you would have seen the return.</p> <h2>Tips for creating a direct marketing campaign that works</h2> <p id=\"1da78c54-6cc1-40a5-b190-c285a633ae2f\">Now that you have a direct marketing budget, it is time to make sure that your campaigns generate a positive return on investment.</p> <p id=\"1da78c54-6cc1-40a5-b190-c285a633ae2f\">Carefully consider the following:</p> <ul> <li>Who is your target market?</li> <li>What are their needs?</li> <li>What are their buying triggers?</li> <li>How will you reach them?</li> <li>What channels will you use?</li> <li>What type of message will resonate?</li> <li>What offer will you make?</li> <li>What call to action will you include?</li> <li>How will you measure success?</li> </ul> <p id=\"1da78c54-6cc1-40a5-b190-c285a633ae2f\">Once you have answers to all of these questions, you can start to develop your tactical direct marketing campaigns.</p> <p id=\"1da78c54-6cc1-40a5-b190-c285a633ae2f\">Remember to test, measure, and iterate as you go. And direct marketing can be a great way to reach consumers during a recession.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"1da78c54-6cc1-40a5-b190-c285a633ae2f\">Committing to marketing spend in a recession can feel like a daunting if not foolhardy prospect, but the research is there to show that it works. Direct marketing might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about how to weather a recession, it can be a powerful tool in your arsenal.</p> <p id=\"1da78c54-6cc1-40a5-b190-c285a633ae2f\">By targeting the right consumers and cutting out intermediaries, businesses can save money on marketing costs, build better products and pass some savings along to the consumer.</p> <p id=\"1da78c54-6cc1-40a5-b190-c285a633ae2f\">So if you are looking for a business strategy during recession, or would like case studies of how direct marketing can help, <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/contact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">please drop us a line</a>.</p> <hr /> <div style=\"grid-template-columns:32% auto\"><figure style=\"background-image:url(https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-1024x640.png);background-position:50% 50%\"><a href=\"https://chris-q9avi0iq.scoreapp.com/p/the-distinctive-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-1024x640.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-1024x640.png 1024w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-300x188.png 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup-768x480.png 768w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/Are-you-lost-in-the-crowd-or-leading-the-pack_-Mockup.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure><div> <h4>Is your brand truly distinctive? </h4> <p>Many brands struggle to carve out a unique space in their market.

They will be adept at stakeholder management and also be able to influence at a C-suite level as well as motivate a marketing team.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Engaging with one would typically involve hiring them to work with your company on a part-time or project basis.

This gives your business flexibility in your approach and you can increase or decrease your commitment over time based on your needs. Your business will benefit from the insight and experience that an expert can bring, but only pay for the time you need.</p> <h3>Scalability</h3> <p>The ability to scale your marketing efforts up or down as needed, without a long-term commitment.

Because they work on your behalf but are annexed to your business, you will benefit from their greater objectivity.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Quite often an external perspective can be useful to identify issues within your business, that a full-time employee may not feel comfortable voicing. Also due to the nature of working this way a fractional marketer will not get caught up in the politics of your business, and are there to deliver rather than climb a corporate ladder or bolster their CV.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">As a result, they will focus on your business needs and the role you have assigned them to deliver on your objectives.</p> <h3>Marketing Rigour</h3> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">A good fractional marketing expert will be able to enforce some rigour into your marketing function.

Having a senior manager looking after the needs of your business, rather than working on vanity projects, will have a positive impact on your bottom line.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">Tasks such as implementing processes, measuring effectiveness, customer research, and understanding lifetime value should become much clearer within your business. They will also instil this rigour within your existing team, as well as be able to teach best practices and call out poor performance.</p> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">These are just some of the few benefits your business will enjoy by using a fractional marketing expert, but if you are still not sure, there are some <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/why-a-fractional-marketing-director/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">key signs</a> that your business could need one.</p> <h2 id=\"choose\">Choosing the right one for your needs</h2> <p id=\"4991f3f3-183b-4ce1-b2d3-b625c1042347\">When choosing a fractional marketing expert, it&#8217;s important to consider their skills, experience, and areas of expertise.

But there are still many myths and misconceptions about them.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">People often think that they are expensive and only for businesses with a lot of money to spend. But that&#8217;s not always the case.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/fractional-marketing-expert-uk/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fractional marketing experts can benefit businesses</a> of all sizes and budgets to get the most out of their marketing efforts. So let&#8217;s debunk some of these myths and set the record straight.</p> <h2>Myths and Reality</h2> <h3>Myth 1: Fractional directors are only for big businesses with deep pockets</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/why-a-fractional-marketing-director/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fractional marketing directors</a> can help businesses of all sizes get the most out of their marketing budget. Whether you have a large budget or a small one, a fractional marketing expert can help you create a strategic plan that fits your needs and gets the most bang for your buck.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">Many will have worked at or with startups and will have experience in intensively bootstrapping a business to profitability and scale.</p> <h3>Myth 2: Fractional marketing experts are too expensive</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> The <a href=\"https://authenticbrand.com/fractional-cmo/fractional-cmo-cost/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cost of a fractional marketing expert</a> is often less than the cost of hiring a full-time employee. When you hire a fractional marketing expert, you only pay for the time and expertise that you need. This can save you a lot of money in the long run.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">The added benefit is that you will have a senior leader in your business who will be able to define <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">marketing strategy</a> and ensure you have the best product-market fit.</p> <h3>Myth 3: Fractional marketing experts are a luxury</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality</strong>: Fractional marketing experts can save you money. By helping you create a plan and execute it efficiently, a fractional marketing expert can help you avoid costly mistakes.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">They are acutely aware of their billing rates, and a good practitioner will almost always ensure that they have saved your business more than they have cost. Alternatively made you a positive return on investment in terms of additional sales.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">In fact, not having a senior marketing leader in your business could cost you money in the long run, through missed opportunities, lack of direction, and lack of accountability in your marketing function.</p> <h3>Myth 4: Fractional marketing experts won&#8217;t understand my business</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> Fractional marketing experts are experienced professionals who have worked with businesses of all sizes and industries.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">They understand the challenges that businesses face and actually, as part of their engagement they will want to <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2015/10/14/how-to-scan-through-your-environments-disruptive-threats-and-opportunities\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analyse your marketplace and competition</a>. In this capacity, their distance from the day-to-day of your business is an advantage and will yield better opportunity insights.</p> <h3>Myth 5: We can undertake digital transformation ourselves</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> With their extensive experience, they can help you navigate the digital landscape and find the right tools and strategies for your business. Digital transformation is a complex process, and it&#8217;s constantly changing. A fractional marketing expert can save you time and money by avoiding the pitfalls that less experienced marketers might make.</p> <h3>Myth 6: Without a formal full-time role fractional marketing experts are unable to affect change.</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> Fractional marketing experts are change agents. Unlike consultants, who simply offer advice, fractional marketing experts roll up their sleeves and help you implement the changes that they recommend.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">This hands-on approach ensures that the changes are made efficiently and effectively. Also not being engaged in your business permanently full-time means that they can push changes that are unpopular but are in the best interests of your business.</p> <h3>Myth 7: Fractional marketing experts can only help if we have a marketing-related issue.</h3> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\"><strong>Reality:</strong> This is a moot point, but most experts will have had the experience of managing multi-disciplined teams across, technical, product, development, operations, and even customer service.</p> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">They often become the CEO’s right-hand person, managing strategic and operational issues as they relate to marketing. This provides an invaluable outside perspective that can help businesses of all sizes solve problems and achieve their goals.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"c22de7ff-796d-408a-a856-e29f09c59516\">Fractional marketing experts are a great choice for businesses of all sizes and budgets.

By creating a Google Business Profile and posting regularly, businesses can improve their visibility online, and build trust and credibility with potential customers. Google says &#8220;Your Business Profile on Google Search and Maps can help you attract new customers and grow your business.&#8221;</p> <ol> <li>What are Google business profile posts?</li> <li>Types of Google Profile Business Posts that you can use</li> <li>How to create a post</li> <li>Why you should use posts to promote your business:</li> </ol> <h2>What are Google business profile posts?</h2> <p id=\"3633d263-08d1-4761-b47e-54b3141118de\">With Google business profile posts business owners can post updates about their business that are associated with their profile. These posts help existing and new customers know more about your business.</p> <p id=\"3633d263-08d1-4761-b47e-54b3141118de\">The posts are a bit like Facebook posts in that they can be reshared from your profile and posted onto other social networks or via email. Unfortunately, unlike social networks, users cannot like or comment on your posts or share within the ecosystem as users do not have their own profiles.</p> <p id=\"3633d263-08d1-4761-b47e-54b3141118de\">Users will see these posts in a variety of places including Google Maps environments including the app, SERPS, and Local Search:</p> <figure><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=polything+marketing+consultancy&amp;oq=polything+marketing+consultancy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.12590j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"592\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/image-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Polything Marketing Consultancy Google Business Profile\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/image-1.jpeg 700w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/image-1-300x254.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></figure> <h2>Types of posts you can use:</h2> <p id=\"cc0c2873-d4e2-4fdc-ac38-232e4a0e5132\">There are a few different types of posts you can use on your Google Profile Business page.</p> <h3>What&#8217;s new</h3> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">These posts are general updates on your business, it is easy to include photos or videos, a description together with an action button to lead users to find out more. They can be used for updates on opening hours, promotions, or things like address changes.</p> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">These types of posts are great for building brand awareness and affinity and in some countries also get surfaced automatically by Google based on your reviews rating and search intent.</p> <h3>Events</h3> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">If you&#8217;re hosting an event, using Google Business Profile is a great way to promote it. You can share event details, such as the date, time (start and end), location, and a brief description. As with What&#8217;s New posts, these posts can include photos, videos, descriptions, and action buttons.</p> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">Customers will be able to see your event posts in Google Maps and Google Search. Events under some circumstances can be surfaced on your business in the Overview section of your business profile, Google does not publish what the criteria are for this to happen, however.

Although less relevant for most businesses now, this is where you can include changes to your business hours, any new safety measures you have put in place, or even temporary closures. At the time this was a useful way for businesses to build trust with their customers and let them know which COVID-19 measures they had in place.</p> <h2>How to create a Google Profile Business Post</h2> <p id=\"4a4411f1-077c-40b6-82f7-3b0581ad12f6\">Creating a post is relatively straightforward,&nbsp;to create a Google Profile Business Post:</p> <ol> <li>Sign in to Google My Business.</li> <li>Choose the location you&#8217;d like to manage.</li> <li>Click Posts from the menu.</li> <li>In the top right, click Write a post.</li> <li>Choose the type of post you&#8217;d like to create.</li> <li>Enter the details of your post, then click Publish.</li> </ol> <h2>Why you should use posts to promote your business:</h2> <p id=\"947b45ee-d88e-4e71-8631-a637e6717439\">There are a few key reasons why you should use Google Profile Business Posts to promote your business:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Reach a wider audience:</strong> By creating a Google Business Profile and posting regularly, businesses can improve their visibility online and reach a wider audience.

Within an organizational context, it is a valuable tool that can help businesses grow by fostering the development of their employees. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore what it is, how it differs from coaching, and the benefits it can bring to your business.</p> <h2>What is Mentoring?</h2> <p>Mentoring is a relationship between two individuals, where the mentor acts as a guide and counsellor, sharing their knowledge and experience to help the mentee achieve their goals. Julie Starr defines a mentor as “someone who takes on the role of a trusted advisor, supporter, teacher and wise counsel to another person. A mentor adopts a primarily selfless role in supporting the learning development and ultimate success of another person” (<a href=\"https://starrcoaching.co.uk/team/julie-starr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starr </a>2021).</p> <p>The mentor provides guidance, advice, and support, and helps the mentee build the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their role. These relationships are typically long-term, with regular meetings over a period of several months or even years.</p> <h2>The difference between mentoring and coaching?</h2> <p>While coaching and mentoring share some similarities, they are different processes with different goals. CIPD defines coaching as aiming &#8220;to produce optimal performance and improvement at work. It focuses on specific skills and goals, although it may also have an impact on an individual’s personal attributes such as social interaction or confidence” (<a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/fundamentals/people/development/coaching-mentoring-factsheet#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CIPD</a>). Coaching is typically focused on helping an individual improve their performance in a specific area, such as communication or time management. The coach works with the individual to set goals and develop a plan to achieve them. Coaching is usually time-limited, with a defined end-point, and is focused on short-term goals and immediate results.</p> <p>Mentoring, on the other hand, is more holistic and long-term. The mentor helps the mentee develop their skills and knowledge in a range of areas, and provides guidance and support as they grow and progress in their role. The mentor helps the mentee identify their strengths and weaknesses, and supports them as they work to overcome challenges and achieve their goals.</p> <h2>The importance of mentoring to your business</h2> <p>Mentors can bring a range of benefits to your business, including:</p> <ul> <li>Improved employee development: It helps employees build the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their role, which can lead to improved job performance and career progression.</li> <li>Increased engagement and motivation: It helps employees feel valued and supported, which can increase their engagement and motivation levels.</li> <li>Better retention: It helps employees build strong relationships with their colleagues, which can improve their sense of belonging and reduce the risk of turnover.</li> <li>Improved succession planning: It can help you identify and develop future leaders within your organization, which can help you plan for succession and ensure a smooth transition of leadership.</li> <li>Improved diversity and inclusion: it can help create a more inclusive workplace by providing opportunities for employees from diverse backgrounds to connect and grow.</li> </ul> <h2>Structure, Duration, and Expertise</h2> <p>When it comes to mentoring, the structure, duration, and expertise of the relationship can vary widely depending on the needs of the individuals involved. Some common structures for relationships include one-on-one meetings, group sessions, and email or phone correspondence. The duration of a relationship can range from several months to several years, depending on the goals of the individuals involved.</p> <p>When it comes to expertise, the mentor should have relevant knowledge and experience in the area they are mentoring in. For example, if a mentee is looking to develop their leadership skills, they may seek out a mentor with experience in leadership and management. The mentor should also have strong interpersonal skills, be a good listener, and be able to provide constructive feedback.</p> <p>A quote to ponder:</p> <figure><blockquote><p> “The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting” <br /></p><cite>(Plutarch)</cite></blockquote></figure> <p>In conclusion, mentoring and coaching offer a wide range of benefits to individuals and organizations. Whether your goal is to improve employee engagement and productivity or to develop leadership skills, both mentoring and coaching can help you achieve your goals and drive business growth.

Visit Google&#8217;s main search console page (<a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">search.google.com</a>) where you can sign into Google search console . Google will ask you to verify that you own the website associated with your Gmail account, so it&#8217;s important to make sure that the site is set up correctly before verifying your ownership of it (see step two).</p> <p>After signing in to your account for the first time you&#8217;ll be directed to the Google search console dashboard. At this point you will need to add a new property by following Google&#8217;s instructions.

For those unfamiliar with <a href=\"https://www.digitalboost.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital Boost</a>, it is a platform which helps start-ups, small businesses and charities get the support they need to grow. They do this by matching organisations who need support with volunteer experts for free one-to-one advice, small group workshops and learning resources. It is a great resource, so if you need support and are based in the UK I would highly suggest you check it out.</p>  <p>I have been mentoring on the platform for a number of months now, and I was very honoured to be asked to host a Masterclass on their platform. The experience was great and the group was very engaged and asked lots of questions. My only issue was that maybe I could have helped more people as the group was limited to fifteen people. So Digital Boost agreed to give me a copy of the recording so that I could post it here. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ve done a bit of tidying up and what was an hour-long session has been cut down to half an hour. Sorry if I drone on a bit, but I promise you that there are some real nuggets in there! There is a download link below if you would like to get the step-by-step guide.</p>  <p>Please enjoy, and let me know if you have any feedback:</p> <figure><div> <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How do Facebook Ads work?\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTjf0rI9vPI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div></figure>  <p>Thanks for watching and I hope you got something out of this Facebook Ads Masterclass. If you would like to learn more about paid media, <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/customer-journey-maps/\" >understanding customer journey mapping</a>, or marketing in general feel free to drop us a line or book a free strategy call. As promised, below you will find links to a list of resources, including a fourteen-page handout with will walk you through the process of setting up your first campaign.</p> <p>Many small businesses do not have the resources to undertake our <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >Momentum Model</a> or a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >bespoke consultancy project</a>. So in an effort to help these businesses improve their strategy and turn this into profits and growth, we have started to offer a mentoring service. Unfortunately, we can only afford to service a small number of clients at the moment, but if you are interested please tick the box below to receive information on how it works.</p>

ways of working tremendously during our coaching sessions. Every barrier I was facing Chris found solutions that were easy to implement and use moving forward.<br />We had great discussions every session and Chris always picked up on little details in what I was saying and was able to find the most amazing information to send over which I not only found useful for myself but was also able to share with my colleagues who also found the information very useful. In all honesty I didn't want my sessions with Chris to end! I started our sessions with low confidence and a bit of a mess in my head as to the structure of my working day and I came out with clear plans and strategies thanks to Chris. I highly recommend Chris's coaching sessions.

My reservations were around a formulaic lesson by lesson method but Chris worked with me to get the best outcomes. Chris was able to provide insight in multiple areas, often within a very short window, and with zero preparation. The sessions were conversational, which, was exactly what worked for me. Every session was beneficial and it was a shame when our sessions ended. I am very confident in recommending Chris to anyone who is thinking about engaging an ND coach.

Where else could we start, but with Amazon?</p> <p id=\"01bdabe1-b449-45de-a271-63667f9f7bd0\">Love them or hate them, everyone has to admit that they are one of the most omnipresent and successful companies out there. But how did they achieve this? And how did their marketing strategy contribute to this success? In the following article, we will answer these questions as well as outline the marketing strategy of Amazon&#8217;s success.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"#strategy\" >What is Amazon&#8217;s marketing strategy?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#how\" >How did they become so successful?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#customer\" >The importance of customer obsession</a></li> <li><a href=\"#future\" >Amazon marketing in the future</a></li> </ul> <h2 id=\"strategy\">Amazon&#8217;s marketing strategy</h2> <p id=\"bb277d77-04f5-4ee2-96f1-8dc504776b9a\">Amazon&#8217;s marketing strategy hinges on <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">customer obsession</a>. By focusing on the needs and wants of its customers, Amazon has been able to create a unique shopping experience that cannot be found anywhere else. It has also used its marketing strategy to expand into new markets and product categories, which has helped to further solidify its position as a market leader.</p> <p id=\"bb277d77-04f5-4ee2-96f1-8dc504776b9a\">There are three sub-pillars that support the marketing strategy of Amazon:</p> <p id=\"bb277d77-04f5-4ee2-96f1-8dc504776b9a\"><strong>Product Range</strong> &#8211; Starting with books and then expanding across verticals, Amazon offers a wide range of products across almost every category vertical. Amazon stocks so many category lines now that it is the default starting point for the world when looking for a new product, whatever your needs.</p> <p id=\"bb277d77-04f5-4ee2-96f1-8dc504776b9a\"><strong>Customer Service Interface </strong>&#8211; Amazon&#8217;s customer service is world-renowned for its speed and efficiency. Removing friction from the buying process has been a constant focus since its inception, and Amazon has infact informed how all e-commerce works today. From checkout experiences to receiving and items, each step in the process has been iterated over decades to the point where it is almost frictionless for consumers.</p> <p id=\"bb277d77-04f5-4ee2-96f1-8dc504776b9a\"><strong>Scalability</strong> &#8211; Amazon invests in systems and marketing practices that can scale, to the extent that if that solution does not exist, then they will build their own service, as with AWS. Everything in the ecosystem is designed to scale including its marketing efforts.</p> <p id=\"bb277d77-04f5-4ee2-96f1-8dc504776b9a\"><strong>Networks Effects</strong> &#8211; Amazon harnesses the power of the network and the marketplace to deliver exponential returns. By using network effects they have been able to keep their cost base low enough to be highly innovative and service the needs of their customers. By using marketplaces it has been able to tap into pre-existing industries such as affiliate marketing to do the heavy lifting of creating brand awareness as well as generating sales.</p> <h2 id=\"how\">How did Amazon become so successful?</h2> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">At the core of Amazon&#8217;s success has been its focus on customers, combined with the company&#8217;s culture of preventing itself. This company culture comes in part from Bezos himself and can be observed through his <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">letters to shareholders</a>. &#8220;We want to be a large company that&#8217;s also an invention machine with the speed of movement&#8230; normally associated with startups.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Bezos</a></p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">Customer obsession is a constant in his letters from 1997 through to the present day and is the main reason that they have been so successful. But there are other themes that come out of these letters.</p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">A willingness to fail is another theme that is worth examining. Amazon consistently places big bets on products and services without there being much certainty of success from the outside.</p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">You might remember the Fire phone as a failure, but actually, there have been many more including; Amazon wallet, Amazon music importer, zshops, kozmo.com, Testdrive, and Storybuilder, to name just a few. Failure and a willingness to try and fail are ingrained in Amazon&#8217;s business culture. It is only from this that revolutionary innovation will occur.</p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">Finally urging investors to be patient and look to the long term is another of Bezos&#8217; themes in letters to shareholders. Planning forward to where demand will be in 5-10 years&#8217; time has been critical to its success. By being ahead of the trend and demand Amazon can ensure that is a market leader before there is even a market. This culture has been critical to Amazon&#8217;s continued success, even if there are some casualties like Fire phone along the way.</p> <h2 id=\"customer\">The importance of customer obsession in Amazon&#8217;s marketing strategy</h2> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">Amazon has always been customer-obsessed, and this is one of the main reasons for its success. It has consistently placed the customer at the centre of everything it does, and this has resulted in a loyal customer base that keeps coming back increasing customer lifetime value.</p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">A useful amazon marketing strategy case study would be its <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Private-Label/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5489552031\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">private label business</a>. In 1999 it opened its platform and launched its third-party marketplace for other retailers. However, over the years the platform started to become flooded with third-party sellers who were sourcing generally low-quality products from China that had previously been absent from Amazon&#8217;s catalogue.</p> <p id=\"77efb489-ff1c-4ad3-994b-59d3e8ffec85\">Amazon recognised that consumers wanted low-cost alternatives to many branded products, but understood that consumers were generally unhappy with these cheap third-party seller products that were on its marketplace platform. So in 2007, Amazon launched its own private label line which would directly compete directly with these FBA sellers, even though they were receiving sales commission from these third-party sellers. Amazon knew that they could sell better products at the same price point and improve customer satisfaction with them.</p> <h2 id=\"future\">The future of Amazon&#8217;s marketing strategy</h2> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">It is evident that Amazon will continue to be customer-obsessed and will continue to innovate in order to maintain its position as a market leader. It has already started to move into new areas such as groceries with the acquisition of Whole Foods, and it is likely that we will see Amazon move into other areas as well.</p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">It is also worth noting that Amazon is not afraid to copy successful ideas from other companies and adapt them to its own business. For example, the company recently introduced Amazon Go, a new type of retail store that uses technology to eliminate checkouts and allow customers to simply walk out with the items they want. This is similar to the concept of &#8216;scan-and-go&#8217; that has been trialled by other retailers such as Walmart.</p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">By continuing to be customer-obsessed, Amazon will no doubt continue to be a success in the years to come. The marketing strategy of Amazon plays an important role in this company&#8217;s success story.</p> <p id=\"626cfd2b-72b4-43c3-b188-798528626c45\">Thank you for reading!

To maximise the impact of mentoring, it&#8217;s important to understand how the organisational context affects it.</p> <h2>Culture</h2> <p>The culture of the organisation is a key factor that can influence the success of mentoring programs. As Gerry Johnson and Kevan Scholes note, &#8220;You can expose cultural assumptions and practices, and set to work aligning organisational elements with one another, and with your strategy&#8221; (Johnson et al., <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mindtools</a>). An organisation that has a culture of coaching and mentoring is more likely to embrace a mentoring program, and the intervention is more likely to be successful due to its inherent openness to it. Senior leaders who have been engaged as a mentor are also more likely to support mentoring programs and gain buy-in from the rest of the businesses. Mentoring is more likely to be successful in organisations that have a culture of openness, where both mentors and mentees have a sense of psychological security, resulting in better development outcomes.</p> <p>To get a more in-depth understanding of how the organisation&#8217;s culture can affect mentoring, we can use the &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.personio.com/hr-lexicon/cultural-web-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cultural web&#8217;</a> analysis developed by Gerry Johnson and Kevan Scholes. This analysis examines and exposes the stories, rituals and routines, symbols, organisational structure, control systems, and power structures within an organisation. By using it, &#8220;you can expose cultural assumptions and practices, and set to work aligning organisational elements with one another, and with your strategy&#8221; (Johnson et al., Mindtools).</p> <p>Within companies that have a culture of openness, mentoring is also more likely to be successful. If both mentors and mentees have a sense of psychological security, better relationships will be formed, and openness will result in better development outcomes. On the other hand, if an organisation&#8217;s culture is not supportive of mentoring, it may be challenging to get the necessary buy-in and resources to make a mentoring programme successful.</p> <h2>Resource</h2> <p>Another critical component of a successful mentoring program is scoping and resourcing it appropriately. Leaders within the business need to understand this explicitly, and the potential return on investment is important to get buy-in. &#8220;If insufficient funding, external resource and time are allocated to a program, at best it is likely to be ineffective, at worst case damaging to the profession as a whole&#8221; (Johnson et al., <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mindtools</a>). Organisations that have had a poor experience with a mentoring program are unlikely to try another attempt at mentoring in the future.</p> <h2>Structure</h2> <p>The way an organisation is structured can have an impact on the nature and success of a mentoring program. For example, larger businesses tend to have more formal matrix structures and hierarchies, which may make mentees uncomfortable seeking guidance from more experienced staff. On the other hand, flatter structures can present problems if there is not a clear differentiation in terms of experience and leadership between mentor and mentee. Smaller organisations may also struggle if they do not have enough experienced staff to start a program and may have to look outside the organisation for help.</p> <h2>Diversity</h2> <p>Diversity is another often overlooked issue when it comes to the success of mentoring programs. Organisations that are diverse and inclusive are more likely to succeed in this respect. As Nancy Kline notes, &#8220;We learn so much from people who are not like us&#8221; (Kline, <a href=\"https://www.timetothink.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Time to Think</a>). Mentors who come from different backgrounds collectively have more experience to offer than might be relatable to the mentees in the organisation. To maximise the impact of a mentoring program, it may be necessary to bring in mentors from different backgrounds to have a good matching process.</p> <h2>Support</h2> <p>As with any new development within a business, overt and continued support can affect the success of mentoring. It is important from the outset that an organisation promotes the program and management at all levels support and promote it to their teams. &#8220;The more the organisation gets behind the intervention as a whole, the more likely it is to succeed&#8221; (Johnson et al., Mindtools).</p> <h2>Communication</h2> <p>Finally, communication within the organisation needs to be good to ensure a successful program. businesses that already have open lines and utilise feedback are more likely to have employees open to constructive feedback and understand the importance of open communication. As Nancy Kline notes, &#8220;The quality of everything we do depends on the quality of the thinking we do first&#8221; (Kline, Time to Think).</p> <p>In conclusion, it is important to understand that the success of a mentoring program is largely dependent on the organisational context in which it is implemented. The culture, resources, structure, diversity, support, and communication within the business can significantly impact the effectiveness of the <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" >mentoring program</a>.</p> <p>Organisations that have a culture of coaching and mentoring, are more likely to engage in a scheme of mentoring and it is also more likely that the intervention will be successful due to the inherent openness to it. The way an organisation is structured can sometimes have an impact on the nature and success of a mentoring program. Flatter structures can also present problems if there is not a clear differentiation in terms of experience and leadership between mentor and mentee. Organisations that are diverse and inclusive are more likely to succeed in this respect.</p> <p>It is important to be aware of all these factors when considering a mentoring program, as depending on the organisational context it may not be appropriate, or in fact, the most effective intervention in all situations. Mentoring is good at affecting some changes, but not all, so at the outset, clear expectations should be set of what is possible with this type of intervention.</p> <p>Overall, the success of a mentoring program depends on careful consideration of the organisational context and addressing these factors can help ensure a successful mentoring program.</p> <p>For more information on mentoring, please see my previous article on the <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/how-can-mentoring-help-your-business-grow/\" >basics of mentoring</a>.</p>",

However, it is important to note that this method is subject to biases, particularly if the mentee has had a negative experience. Other ways to assess improvements in skills and behaviours include peer review of the mentee and more formal performance-based measures. For instance, a direct manager can provide feedback on performance areas before and after the mentoring intervention, and the results can be compared to show any changes in performance.</p> <h2>Organisational Level</h2> <p>On the organisational level, there are several HR measures that can be used to assess the impact of mentoring. One key measure is employee retention, which is also used to measure the impact of training, promotion opportunities, bonuses, and workplace policies and procedures. If not already in place, employee retention can be assessed retrospectively based on employee data. Another measure is employee satisfaction surveys, which may already be an ongoing study. However, if not, it would need to be deployed before and after the intervention to measure any uplift in satisfaction within the businesses. To get a truer picture of the impact, the survey can be blind-tested with mentors and mentees against those employees who were not involved in the program.</p> <p>Showing an impact on return on investment (ROI) is also possible if the invention is approached in the right way. It is harder to prove ROI for mentoring than coaching since the impact of mentoring takes longer to be perceived and recognized. In such cases, the hard costs and resource costs of the program would be calculated and compared to the opportunity costs of hiring new staff and training them based on the increase in retention. Direct performance ROI would be even harder to assess due to the number of factors that influence that number. However, blind testing could give a reasonable assessment of the impact of mentoring.</p> <p>A different approach is to consider Return on Expectation (ROE), developed and coined by Donald Kirkpatrick in the 1950s and further developed since. &#8220;By progressing through each of the levels, training evaluators can build a ‘chain of evidence’ which links learning directly with organisational performance&#8221; (&#8220;Training Evaluation: <a href=\"https://www.trainingcheck.com/training-evaluation/kirkpatrick-four-levels-and-roe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kirkpatrick Four Levels and ROE TrainingCheck</a>&#8220;). Stakeholders&#8217; expectations of the intervention are clarified before the intervention, and &#8220;clear and precise&#8221; (&#8220;Training Evaluation&#8221;) success indicators are aligned with these expectations. During and after the intervention, the actual indicators are assessed and reported back to the stakeholders. This approach is indirect and cannot offer a direct quantification of investment &#8216;in&#8217; and an increase in revenue or profitability &#8216;out&#8217;.</p> <h2>Qualitative and Quantitative Research</h2> <p>Both qualitative and quantitative research can be used to measure the impact of mentoring on both individuals and organisations. <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/qualitative-quantitative.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Qualitative research</a> deals with the collection and analysis of non-numerical data such as words, images, and observations. This type of research would usually take the form of focus groups designed to gain a more in-depth understanding of the impact on both individuals and their organisations. This type of assessment is more likely to uncover more nuanced benefits to individuals and the organisation that couldn&#8217;t be built into quantitative research. However, if qualitative research is undertaken first, those insights can be included in quantitative surveys to understand whether the insights held true at an organisational level.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>In conclusion, assessing the impact of mentoring is an essential aspect of any mentoring program, as it provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the program and its benefits for both mentees and their organizations. As discussed in one of our previous articles on <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/benefits-of-mentoring/\" >the benefits of mentoring</a>, a successful mentoring program can improve employee retention, job satisfaction, and productivity.</p> <p>To evaluate the impact of mentoring, a combination of qualitative and quantitative data can be collected, including self-reported data from mentees, feedback from managers, and performance-based measures. In addition, existing HR measures, such as employee retention and satisfaction surveys, can also be used to assess the impact at an organizational level.</p> <p>Measuring the impact of mentoring can be challenging, but it is essential to determine the return on investment of the program. By using a combination of evaluation methods, and <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/organisational-context-for-mentoring-success/\" >understanding their organisational context</a>, they can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of mentoring and identify areas for improvement.</p> <p>Overall, mentoring is an effective way to develop employees and <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/how-can-mentoring-help-your-business-grow/\" >drive business growth</a>. By implementing a robust and effective mentoring program and regularly assessing its impact, businesses can ensure that they are maximizing the benefits of mentoring for both individuals and the organization as a whole.</p>",

It was created by <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stratgeyzer</a>, which was founded by Alex Osterwalder, a Swiss business strategist, speaker, and consultant, who is known for his work on <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >business modelling</a>. You can download a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/the-value-proposition-canvas.pdf\">value proposition canvas template here</a>.</p> <p id=\"8351d2a4-4454-4c9a-91b0-35cbb0a7f08d\">It can help businesses to identify and understand the different value propositions that a business could offer, and it can help them to better understand what their customers want and need.</p> <p id=\"8351d2a4-4454-4c9a-91b0-35cbb0a7f08d\">The canvas is split into three distinct areas:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The customer profile</strong> &#8211; This is where you define the customer segments that are meaningful to your business. You also describe the jobs (goals) this type of customer is trying to undertake, as well as the pains and gains outcomes they experience in performing the job. This is externally focused and does not include your business.</li> <li><strong>The value map</strong> &#8211; This describes how your company creates value for the customer segment through its product or services. This can be the current state of your business or could be the value you hope to generate by introducing new products or services. This is broken down into the products and services you offer, pain relievers which detail how these products elevate a customer&#8217;s pain and gain creators which describe how the products generate the gains that customers value. This is internally focused and only includes your product suite.</li> <li><strong>The fit </strong>&#8211; This is perhaps the hardest bit of defining a good value proposition. This is where your value map intersects your customer profile to service the highest priority jobs, pains and gains. Quite often it is more important to service 1 or 2 jobs very well than to hard a product suite that services many jobs in a rudimentary way.</li> </ol> <p id=\"8351d2a4-4454-4c9a-91b0-35cbb0a7f08d\">The canvas can help businesses to create a value proposition that is tailored to their specific products or services, and it can help them to better understand their customers&#8217; needs.

A good value proposition is the main reason why customers return to the same company over another.</p> <p id=\"457af7e8-b1a0-452f-8847-ba0ecf0e9c10\">Some value propositions satisfy an entirely new set of needs that customers hadn&#8217;t previously perceived, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.augie.edu/sites/default/files/u57/pdf/jaciel_subdocs/iPhone.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone created the smartphone segment</a>.

Finally, value propositions can offer customisation to suit the needs of specific customer segments for example <a href=\"https://www.oakley.com/en-gb/shop/custom\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Oakley&#8217;s customisable glasses</a>.</p> <h2 id=\"benefits\">What are the benefits of using a value proposition canvas?</h2> <p id=\"9754e782-3b26-4ed4-9621-7db283814219\">They can help businesses to:</p> <ul> <li>It keeps product and marketing teams focused on customers.

Without a clear value proposition that serves a need, thousands of pounds could be lost on ineffectual marketing with the wrong proposition (I see this more often than you might think). Without a value proposition messaging architecture cannot be set up and marketing teams will be testing variants based on hunches.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"how\">9 Steps of how to create a value proposition canvas</h2> <p id=\"fe87f9e0-2a5f-4498-b4c6-b44630928b20\">Here are nine steps you can follow to create your own. Always start with the customer, and the value proposition canvas customer profile:</p> <h3 id=\"segments\">1. Define your customer segments. </h3> <p id=\"fe87f9e0-2a5f-4498-b4c6-b44630928b20\">Try not to model more than three segments at any one time, especially if it is your first time using this canvas. If you have more than three segments form a consensus on which is the most important for driving value to your business.</p> <h3 id=\"jobs\">2. Describe the jobs that customers are trying to undertake. </h3> <p>This is a critical part of the process, don&#8217;t gloss over this or move on until you have explored all the jobs these customers are trying to undertake. The jobs might be functional, social or personal. There might also be more than one job performer, or your job performer may not be the same person that buys the product. Do this for each segment individually.</p> <h3 id=\"pains\">3. Identify the pains and gains associated with those jobs. </h3> <p>Pains are anything that annoys or prevents a customer from getting a job done. These could also be risks of the outcomes of a job being performed badly or not at all. Gains on the other hand describe the benefits and outcomes that customers do want as part of getting their job done. These might be rational expectations when purchasing a solution, or they might be unforeseen benefits that surprise and delight customers.</p> <h3 id=\"break\">4. Take a break. </h3> <p>At this stage, it is really important to take a break and reset. This is because everything that has been considered so far is from the perspective of a consumer. The next stage will be product and business-focused, so it is important to approach it from the perspective of what your business currently offers.</p> <h3 id=\"value\">5. Start the value map and outline your whole product suite. </h3> <p>This should be a relatively quick process as most people will be familiar with what products or services you provide. It is really important at this stage just to list the products or services and not to consider their features or benefits.</p> <h3 id=\"gains\">6. Identify the pain relievers and gain creators as they relate to your product suite. </h3> <p>It is important to note that the first time you do this you should approach it from a current state (i.e. what your company offers today). In later iterations, you might want to consider what pain reliever and gain creators your business could offer in the future. Pain relievers describe how your product specifically alleviates customer pains, while gain creators describe how your product is designed to offer expected gains or benefits.</p> <p>At this point, I would suggest that you end the session and tackle the fit on a different day. In my experience, approaching fit with some time to reflect and a fresh mind yields quicker and better results.</p> <h3 id=\"fit\">7. Evaluate the fit between your products and the pains and gains of your customer segments.</h3> <h3 id=\"consensus\">8. Gain consensus on what the most important jobs are for each customer segment. </h3> <p>Once you have done that consider whether you have evidence for your most important jobs. Next consider, the same for pains and gains. Which pains are most pressing and really need elevating and which gains are most needed. Once you have a consensus on these, it is time to start looking at fit.</p> <h3 id=\"suite\">9. Take each customer segment in turn and take the top three jobs and see how your existing product suite solves that job. </h3> <p>This is your value proposition, how your products solve a really pressing job. Do this for each of your three jobs and you will have nine basic value propositions by the end.</p> <p id=\"fe87f9e0-2a5f-4498-b4c6-b44630928b20\">Once you have completed all these steps you should be able to move on to refine your value proposition and a create messaging hierarchy.

For these people, they have the most relevant free search tool in the world.</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">The second customer is advertisers who want to drive traffic, enquiries and sales to their websites, apps and in-store. For this, they have Google Ads the most targeted ad platform in the world.</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">Finally, publishers need to generate incremental income from their online content, for this, they have Ad Sense and Google Ad Manager where publishers can tap into demand for Google&#8217;s advertisers.</p> <h3>Apple Genius Bar</h3> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Apple_Value_Proposition.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Value Proposition\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Apple_Value_Proposition.jpg 1000w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Apple_Value_Proposition-300x169.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Apple_Value_Proposition-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure> <ul> <li>Segment 1 &#8211; High-end devices with built-in tech support</li> </ul> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">Based on a growing direct-to-consumer trend Apple decided to launch a range of flagship stores in 2001. This was the first time in their history that they had ever sold through physical stores. Why?</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">To underpin the demands of tech early adopters they recognised that consumers wanted high-end devices but needed support in upgrading and maintaining them. To manage the customer experience from end to end they launched stores and created the Genius Bar to service the needs of these early adopters.</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">The Genius Bar adopted a human-centred approach to help customers feel enabled and masters of their cutting-edge devices.</p> <h3>Netflix</h3> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Netflix-Value_Proposition.jpg\" alt=\"Netflix Value Proposition\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Netflix-Value_Proposition.jpg 1000w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Netflix-Value_Proposition-300x169.jpg 300w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/Netflix-Value_Proposition-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure> <ul> <li>Segment 1 &#8211; Movies by Mail</li> <li>Segment 2 &#8211; Content streaming platform</li> <li>Segment 3 &#8211; High value commissioning budgets</li> </ul> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">As internet speeds increase around 2007, Netflix saw an opportunity to evolve its value proposition which in turn revolutionised its business model. Netflix&#8217;s value proposition quickly evolved from a mail-order DVD company into a streaming platform with some unforeseen benefits.</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">Technology drove the innovation but Netflix capitalised on this with a subscription model which financed its platform development and serviced customers better than their original value proposition.</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">The economies of scale or operating a platform rather than paying for the cost of distributing DVDs meant that they could disrupt the traditional commissioning process of TV and Movie markets, giving production companies an alternative choice.</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">Production companies enjoyed more generous production budgets versus TV, as the TV industry was starting to come under pressure from changes in consumer habits. Scheduled TV was beginning to become a thing of the past and consumers were demanding to be able to watch their favourite programmes on-demand in their own time.</p> <p id=\"b1e30c31-5434-48f8-907e-5302710941c0\">Drop us a line if you would like to learn more about Netflix&#8217;s business model and receive a <a href=\"http://about:blank/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free Netflix business model canvas</a>.</p> <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"8351d2a4-4454-4c9a-91b0-35cbb0a7f08d\">Value proposition canvases are amazing strategic tools to create business alignment. They can be used to create a common language within your business to describe the challenges you face as well as the value you provide.

However, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that there are potential barriers that can prevent a mentoring relationship from being successful. In this article, we&#8217;ll examine some of the most common barriers to mentoring and provide strategies for successful mentoring.</p> <h2>Organisational Barriers</h2> <h3>Time Barrier</h3> <p>One of the most common barriers to mentoring is a lack of time. Mentors and mentees may have busy schedules, conflicting demands, or feel that they don&#8217;t have the resources to dedicate to mentoring. </p> <p>To overcome this barrier, businesses can take several steps. First, they can ensure that all departments are adequately resourced so that employees have the time and support they need to participate in mentoring programs. Second, they can emphasise the importance of mentoring to both mentors and mentees, so that they understand the value of making time for the relationship. Finally, businesses can set aside dedicated time for mentoring, such as a weekly or monthly meeting, to ensure that the relationship is given the attention it deserves.</p> <h3>Diversity Barrier</h3> <p>Another potential barrier to mentoring is a lack of diversity. When mentors all come from similar backgrounds, it can be challenging for mentees to form meaningful relationships and benefit from the mentor&#8217;s experience. </p> <p>To overcome this barrier, businesses should aim to build mentoring programs that include mentors from a range of experiences and backgrounds. This could involve offering specific programs for underrepresented groups and encouraging mentors who identify with these groups to participate. Additionally, all mentors should receive diversity and inclusion training before launching a program, so that they are better equipped to work with a wide range of mentees.</p> <h2>Individual Barriers</h2> <h3>Communication Barrier</h3> <p>Effective communication is key to any successful mentoring relationship. However, there are many factors that can create a communication barrier, including language differences, communication style, or the nature of the communication itself. </p> <p>To overcome this barrier, it&#8217;s important that both parties are trained in effective communication, and that mentors are aware of their responsibilities to adapt their communication to fit the needs of their mentees. When there is a language barrier, it&#8217;s essential to ensure that mentors and mentees are matched with people who share the same mother tongue or can communicate simply and clearly. Mentors should also replay their understanding of what the mentee has said to reach a mutual understanding.</p> <h3>Incompatibility Barrier</h3> <p>Sometimes, mentors and mentees will find that they have incompatible personalities, value systems, religions, or worldviews. In these situations, it may be difficult for a good relationship to be established. </p> <p>To overcome this barrier, mentors should receive training on how to work with people with differences in personality and communication style. Additionally, the process of matching mentors and mentees can provide a good solution to mismatches. This could involve using surveys or psychometric tests to find greater alignment between interests, goals, and personalities. However, caution should be taken to avoid an &#8220;echo chamber&#8221; effect, where mentees are only exposed to similar perspectives. Ultimately, there should be a process in place for mentors and means.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>In conclusion, mentoring is a powerful tool that can be used to develop individuals in a variety of settings. In this series of articles, we have explored <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/how-can-mentoring-help-your-business-grow/\" >what mentoring is and how it differs from coaching</a>. We discussed the different types of mentoring, including formal, informal, and peer-to-peer mentoring. We also explored the advantages and disadvantages of each type of mentoring. </p> <p>We also explored how <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/organisational-context-for-mentoring-success/\" >organisation context</a> can have an impact on its success.</p> <p>We then delved into the <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/benefits-of-mentoring/\">benefits of mentoring</a> for individuals and businesses. We explored how mentoring can improve job satisfaction, increase employee retention, and help individuals develop new skills and knowledge.</p> <p>Next, we looked at how to implement successful mentoring programs and how the <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/measure-the-impact-of-mentoring/\">success and impact of mentoring can be measured</a>. We discussed the importance of setting clear goals, identifying the right mentors, and providing adequate resources to ensure the success of the program.</p> <p>In this final article, we identified potential barriers to mentoring and developed strategies to overcome these barriers. We discussed the importance of addressing organizational barriers such as time and diversity, as well as individual barriers such as communication, incompatibility, and commitment.</p> <p>By implementing the strategies we&#8217;ve discussed in this series, businesses can create successful mentoring programs that benefit both the mentor and the mentee. Mentoring can help to develop individuals, increase employee satisfaction, and improve business performance. With the right approach, mentoring can be a powerful tool for any business <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >looking for growth</a>.</p> <p>We hope that this series of articles have been informative and helpful in guiding mentoring.

Just by posting on your favourite social network you are essentially marketing your content to other users, but there are business dangers in this new status duo.</p> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">By doing this, everyone assumes they are a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >good marketer</a> because they got some results, or sold some products. The reality is that marketing is a much more complex subject and strategic planning for marketing, is often neglected by businesses that do not have a dedicated, trained marketer in-house.</p> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">In this article, we will break down what strategic planning for marketing is, how to utilise its power and why you need to have a strategy rather than blindly <a href=\"https://dustinstout.com/social-media-statistics/#:~:text=The%20average%20amount%20of%20time,between%2025%20and%2034%20years.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adding to the millions of posts </a>that are generated every day.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"#what\" >What is strategic planning for marketing and why do we need it?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#how\" >How does strategic planning work and what should be included in a plan?</a></li> <li><a href=\"#benefits\" >The benefits of strategic planning for marketing</a></li> <li><a href=\"#plan\" >How to create a strategic marketing plan for your business</a></li> <li><a href=\"#Conclusion\" >Conclusion</a></li> </ul> <h2>What is strategic planning for marketing and why do we need it?</h2> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">First and foremost strategic planning for marketing has to come after strategic business planning. Often they can be undertaken together, but in essence, a strategic marketing plan first needs the business goals and objectives to be laid out before planning can commence. If you are unsure of how to create a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strategic business plan</a>, please feel free to drop us a line. Once you have your business strategy in place you can move on to create a strategic plan for marketing.</p> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">This plan will involve taking the <a href=\"https://www.dummies.com/article/business-careers-money/business/strategic-planning/set-goals-and-objectives-in-your-business-plan-158846/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business goals and objectives</a> and filtering them through the lens of the market and consumer. This may involve a research phase, depending on how much insight you already have, and even a revisiting of your brand positioning depending on what business objectives have been set. Our advice would always be to start with the consumer and work to understand how you might be able to achieve your objective.</p> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">The next phase of strategic planning for marketing would be to look at channels, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_segmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">segmentation</a>, and messaging. The key to the success of any marketing programme is to reach the right audience, at the right time with messaging that is compelling and promises to solve a pain they have.</p> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">The final phase of strategic planning for marketing is then consider phasing, budget allocation, measurement, and KPIs. This phase provides the information and direction for tactical plans to be developed, executed, and monitored.</p> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">The key reason for spending time on this important work is to create organisational alignment across the business. Also working through consumer needs, wants, pains and gains are critical to developing cost-effective campaigns that will be profitable to your business.</p> <h2 id=\"how\">How does strategic planning work and what should be included in a plan?</h2> <p id=\"fc38379c-7f5c-434c-94bd-286a851949d3\">Strategic planning for marketing works by first identifying your marketing goals and objectives, and then creating a plan of action that will help you to achieve these goals. Your plan should include all aspects of your marketing mix, from your product or service to your pricing, promotion, and distribution.

While some things may stay the same, such as providing valuable content and <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/\" >building an audience</a>, there are other factors you&#8217;ll need to take into account to make your blog stand out. In this post, we&#8217;ll outline what those factors are and how you can make sure your blog is successful.</p> <p id=\"364c9f57-9146-458c-8f19-c40527160d55\">There are a few key changes that have taken place since 2020 that bloggers need to take into account. First, the way people consume content has changed. People are now more likely to consume content on their <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.co.uk/statistics/mobile-internet-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile devices than on desktop</a> computers. This means that your blog needs to be optimized for mobile devices. Additionally, <a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/organic-reach-declining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media platforms have changed</a> the way they operate, which has impacted bloggers who use those platforms to promote their content. Finally, Google&#8217;s algorithms have changed, which means that your blog needs to be more SEO-friendly than ever before.</p> <h2>Choose a topic for your blog and stick with it</h2> <p id=\"5141090c-8bdd-4deb-9891-befe4300a274\">When it comes to blogging, one of the most important things you can do is choose a topic and stick with it. By focusing on a specific topic, you&#8217;ll be able to provide your readers with valuable content that they can&#8217;t find elsewhere. Additionally, by sticking with a specific topic, you&#8217;ll be able to build an audience who is interested in what you have to say.</p> <h2>Ensure your blogging platform or CMS is fast and mobile-friendly</h2> <p id=\"64ce2925-5bcb-4507-87be-03272d74f8cd\">Blogging platforms come in all shapes and sizes, but the most important thing for a blogger is that the platform is fast and mobile-friendly. This is because more and more people are reading blogs on their mobile devices, so you want your blog to be easy to read on any device. If you are using a CMS or blogging platform that is not mobile-friendly, you are likely to lose readers.</p> <h2>Join the online community in your topic area</h2> <p id=\"64ce2925-5bcb-4507-87be-03272d74f8cd\">It’s important to join and engage with the online community on your topic because it will help you get exposure for your blog. When you engage with other people on your topic, they will see your blog and, if they like what they see, they may start following your blog and sharing your content.</p> <h2>Use outreach</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">Outreach is a great way to promote your blog and get it seen by new readers. When you undertake outreach, you send emails or DMs to influencers and other bloggers in your niche and ask them to share your blog with their audience. This is a great way to get your blog seen by a new audience and get some exposure.</p> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">If you can get an influencer to share your blog with their audience, you will get a lot of exposure. One way to get an influencer to share your blog is to guest post on their blog. This will help you get your name out there and get your blog seen by a new audience.</p> <h2>Grow your email list</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">Growing your email list is important because it will help you get more exposure for your blog. When you have a list of email subscribers, you can send them updates about your latest blog posts and they will be more likely to visit your blog and share it with their friends.</p> <p id=\"9c0f6b62-60a8-4987-8aeb-c4f1b2d55d1f\">There are a lot of different ways to grow your email list, but one of the best ways is to create a hook. A hook is something that will get people interested in subscribing to your email list. For example, you could offer a free ebook or report when people subscribe to your email list.</p> <h2>Leverage social media</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">When it comes to promoting your blog, social media is still one of the best tools at your disposal. Not only is it a great way to get your blog seen by a lot of people, but it’s also a great way to get exposure for your content.</p> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">One of the best ways to use social media for promoting your blog is to engage with influencers in your topic area. When you engage with influencers, users will see your blog and, if they like what they see, they may start following your blog and sharing your content.</p> <h2>Make sure your content is SEO-friendly</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">One of the best ways to get your blog seen is to make sure your content is SEO-friendly. This means creating content that is keyword rich and optimized for the search engines. When you create <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/services/\" >SEO-friendly content</a>, you are more likely to get found by readers who are searching for information on the web.</p> <h2>Work on getting referral traffic</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">Referral traffic is the traffic that comes to your blog from other websites. This can be a great way to get your blog seen by new readers. One way to get referral traffic is to guest post on other blogs in your niche. When you guest post, you include a link back to your blog in your author bio. This will help readers find your blog and get exposure to your content.</p> <h2>Be consistent</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">One of the best ways to get your blog seen is to be consistent with your posting schedule. This means posting new content regularly. When you are consistent with your posting schedule, you are more likely to keep readers engaged and coming back for more. One way to make sure you are consistent with your posting schedule is to set up an email outreach schedule. This will help you keep track of your blog posts and make sure you are sending out new content on a regular frequency.</p> <h2>Write original content</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">When it comes to blogging, original content is key. If you constantly rehash the same topics, your readers will get bored and may stop visiting your blog. This is why it’s important to come up with fresh, new ideas for your content.</p> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">One way to come up with new ideas for your content is to get inspired by other bloggers in your niche. Take a look at what they are writing about and see if you can add your own spin to it. Another great way to come up with new ideas is to use social media. See what people are talking about in your niche and get inspired by their conversations.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"0d10da2f-b14f-429b-bef6-c977e53a261f\">What makes a good blog in 2022?

That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential to have someone in your corner who can offer expert guidance and support. <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/business-mentoring/\" >Business mentoring </a>is all about finding a trusted advisor who can help you navigate the challenges and opportunities that come your way.</p> <p>At its core, in the UK business mentoring is about building a relationship based on trust, respect, and mutual benefit. A good mentor can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, set goals, and develop strategies for success. They can also offer valuable insights into industry trends, best practices, and emerging technologies. It is generally agreed that both mentoring and coaching represent “ways to help people learn, change, and manage adversity…” they require a “…relationship of trust, understanding, and authenticity. And… …base their success on the ability to listen” (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-pillars-how-mentoring-differs-from-coaching-rey-carr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Carr 2016</a>).</p> <h2>What Makes a Great Business Mentor?</h2> <p>First things first, you want someone who has been in your shoes and knows the industry inside and out. Look for a mentor who has faced similar challenges and has the experience to guide you through them. You want someone who has been there and done that and can help you navigate the sometimes rocky waters of entrepreneurship. CIPD describes a business mentoring programme as “a relationship in which a more experienced colleague shares their greater knowledge to support the development of an inexperienced member of staff. It calls on the skills of questioning, listening, clarifying and reframing that is also associated with coaching.” (<a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/fundamentals/people/development/coaching-mentoring-factsheet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CIPD “Coaching and Mentoring | Factsheets</a>”)</p> <p>But that&#8217;s not all! A great mentor is also an excellent listener who can offer constructive feedback and help you see things from a fresh perspective. They&#8217;re patient, supportive, and willing to share their knowledge and expertise to help you grow and develop.</p> <p>And finally, you want a mentor who is invested in your success. You want someone who is motivated by seeing you achieve your goals and dreams, not just by the financial rewards of their mentorship.</p> <p>When you find a mentor who possesses all of these qualities, you know you&#8217;ve hit the jackpot. They can help you take your business to new heights, and you&#8217;ll feel confident knowing that you have someone in your corner who believes in you and your vision.</p> <p>So, don&#8217;t be afraid to do your research and take the time to find the perfect mentor for you. Trust me, it&#8217;s worth it.</p> <h2>The benefits of business mentoring</h2> <p>So, why should you consider working with a business mentor? Here are just a few of <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/benefits-of-mentoring/\" >the benefits</a>:</p> <ul> <li>Expert guidance and support</li> <li>Increased confidence and clarity</li> <li>Enhanced leadership and management skills</li> <li>Access to new networks and resources</li> <li>Improved decision-making and problem-solving abilities</li> </ul> <p>A great mentor can help you overcome obstacles, develop your skills and abilities, and achieve your goals. They can also help you build a strong, successful business that makes a real difference in the world.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Think about it &#8211; by finding a trusted advisor who can guide and support you, you can overcome challenges that you never thought possible. You can develop new skills and abilities that will allow you to take on new projects and <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/how-can-mentoring-help-your-business-grow/\" >expand your business </a>in ways you never imagined.</p> <p>The power of business mentoring lies in having someone by your side who has been there, done that, and can share their experience and knowledge with you.

          "raw": "\n<div> <div> <h2>An introduction to our strategic marketing consultancy model</h2> </div> <div> <p>As strategic marketing consultants, the Momentum Model is our primary method of engaging with clients. It is an agile, collaborative and results-focused approach to building and delivering innovative marketing programmes. The model is great for voicing consumer needs, envisioning the future and uncovering fresh insights which may have been overlooked as part of more traditional approaches. It is also useful for reframing business challenges and helping to manage change, especially cultural change.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Momentum Model has been based on over 20 years of practical marketing experience, and five years of experience working directly with a diverse range of direct-to-consumer organisations. Through our consultancy, we saw directly how companies struggle with scaling their marketing exponentially, whilst delivering creativity and remaining focused on serving their customers.</p> <p>The Momentum Model creates the conditions where collaboration and creativity can flourish between multi-disciplinary teams, whilst incrementally improving strategy, outputs and tactical performance.</p> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <h2 style=\"color:#3e3d3d\">Benefits of this method</h2> </div>    </div> <div>  <div> <hr /> <h3 style=\"color:#3e3d3d\">Validation beats guesswork</h3> <p>By collaborating across internal, external and extended teams, new perspectives and ideas can be rapidly generated and validated before deploying in the real world.</p> </div> <div> <hr /> <h3 style=\"color:#3e3d3d\">Structured approach</h3> <p>To successfully scale or launch a marketing programme, firstly, all stakeholders have to be confident in the insight, methodology and approach. We used ‘tested in the wild’ frameworks, methods, tools and playbooks to design an engagement specifically for your needs. Collaboration ensures that everyone in your team has been on the same journey.</p> </div> <div> <hr /> <h3 style=\"color:#3e3d3d\">Unexpected benefits</h3> <p>Giving your teams a common language to articulate your business, its issues, and solutions across product, marketing, sales and operations have unexpected upsides. We see time and again, that although this method is broadly a marketing process, teams will discover and solve business-critical issues across product, development, culture and training within your organisation. They will also find new opportunities in these areas too.</p> </div>  </div> <div>  <div> <hr /> <h3 style=\"color:#3e3d3d\">Training and iterative learning</h3> <p>Through the engagement, the team will learn a common language, ways of describing both business and consumer needs, as well as its problems and challenges. They will become well versed in a variety of strategic frameworks that can be used in the future and that will eventually become part of your company culture. When stakeholders continue to share their journey with their teams, the method will become ingrained in your business, realising benefits and new ideas for years to come.</p> </div> <div> <hr /> <h3 style=\"color:#3e3d3d\">Business agility</h3> <p>Marketing and business practice has moved on from traditional ‘waterfall’ planning and delivery cycles. This model gives your business the ability to refine strategy, innovate, and manage tactical delivery simultaneously. The framework will give you the ability to adapt to market changes, new consumer trends as well as wider macro forces.</p> </div> <div> <hr /> <h3 style=\"color:#3e3d3d\">A collaborative model for scaling marketing results</h3> <p>Inject your business with fresh perspectives, insight and new ideas on how to best serve your customers in the future. Elevated marketing results rarely occur in the context of the same stakeholders sitting in a meeting room day in and day out. Delivering and scaling award-winning marketing programmes now requires collaboration skills and the co-creation of a killer strategy that will resonate with consumers in an attention-deficit world.</p> </div>  </div> <div style=\"background-color:#3e3d3d\">  <div> <div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div> <h2>Exploration<br />Collaboration<br />Experimentation<br />Implementation</h2> </div> <div> <div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div> <p>While our approach, methods and tools work for any size of direct to consumer business, in any industry, we treat each engagement as unique.</p> <p>Depending on the situation, we can bring in experts, influencers, consumers or users to the process to bring fresh perspectives and ideas to your product or problem.

In all honesty I didn't want my sessions with Chris to end! I started our sessions with low confidence and a bit of a mess in my head as to the structure of my working day and I came out with clear plans and strategies thanks to Chris.

Chris was able to provide insight in multiple areas, often within a very short window, and with zero preparation. The sessions were conversational, which, was exactly what worked for me. Every session was beneficial and it was a shame when our sessions ended. I am very confident in recommending Chris to anyone who is thinking about engaging an ND coach.

In all honesty I didn't want my sessions with Chris to end! I started our sessions with low confidence and a bit of a mess in my head as to the structure of my working day and I came out with clear plans and strategies thanks to Chris.

Chris was able to provide insight in multiple areas, often within a very short window, and with zero preparation. The sessions were conversational, which, was exactly what worked for me. Every session was beneficial and it was a shame when our sessions ended. I am very confident in recommending Chris to anyone who is thinking about engaging an ND coach.

It can involve many different strategies, including social media marketing, search engine optimization (SEO), content marketing, and email marketing.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">There are many reasons why you should care about easy growth marketing. First and foremost, it's an incredibly effective way to reach new customers and grow your business. It's also a great way to build brand awareness, affinity, and loyalty. Who doesn't want more people talking about your company?</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Finally, it can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional forms of marketing, which can be expensive and time-consuming. You could go and hire a growth hacker company, but approaching this yourself will pay dividends in the long run.</p> <h2 id=\"basics\">The basics of easy growth marketing</h2> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">There are a few things you should know before you get started with easy growth marketing. First, it's important to <a href=\"https://colemaninsights.com/coleman-insights-blog/start-with-the-customer-and-work-backwards#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">understand your target market</a> and what kinds of strategies are likely to appeal to them. Second, you'll need to adopt a growth-hacking mindset and be prepared to accept 'done' over 'perfect'. You'll need to set some goals for your growth marketing campaigns and determine how you'll measure success. Finally, it's helpful to have a budget in mind, so that you can invest in the right tools and resources.</p> <h2 id=\"8\">8 easy ways to dip your toe into growth marketing</h2> <h3>1. Set up social media profiles.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Creating social media accounts is a quick and easy way to get started with growth marketing. Even if you're not ready to start using them yet, it's good to have them set up so you're ready to go for when you are. Also by taking the time to set them up you will <a href=\"https://seattlewebsearch.com/2022/04/social-media-seo-how-social-signals-impact-search-rankings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">signal to search engines</a> that you are a reputable company and generate valuable links and citations for your business.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: When starting to test channels always test the channels and platforms that your existing customers are using first.</p> <h3>2. Set up an account with an ESP.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">If you're not already using an <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-email-provider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email service provider</a>, now is the time to sign up for one. Having an ESP will allow you to have a way to directly communicate with potential customs and build trust with them. Owning your own consumer data is essential to building your email list and automating some of your marketing at a low cost.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Consider how many emails you might send upfront, also think about the functionality of a system that you will actually use, quite often it is better to start with a simple and high volume system rather than a complex system with heavy overages.</p> <h3>3. Start making data-driven decisions.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">One of the most important aspects of easy growth marketing is making decisions based on data. This means <a href=\"https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/innovation-metrics-\" rel=\"noopener\">using data to track your progress</a> and make changes to your strategy as needed. This needs to become ingrained in your business, so the sooner you start, even with limited tracking and data points the better.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: If you haven't done so already make sure at the very least you are using <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Analytics</a> (it's free), and that you are building a live dashboard of metrics that are meaningful to your business (<a href=\"https://datastudio.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Data Studio</a> is useful for this).</p> <h3>4. Create incredible content.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Content is still king when it comes to digital marketing and is an easy growth marketing technique. If you want to grow your business, you need to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create truly incredible content</a>. This doesn't mean it has to be perfect, but it does need to be interesting and valuable to your target audience.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Start with just one topic area and make sure you have covered the entire topic with different articles that satisfy the needs and questions your customers have. Better to be comprehensive and rank well for a few important topics that spread your efforts too thinly.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: If you are not sure where to start just plug your domain into something like Ubersuggest to get a list of valuable keywords in your niche, then look on Quora to find questions that people have posted on these topics. Finally, write content that answers these questions in detail.</p> <h3>5. Start measuring conversions and optimise them.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Conversions are what matters most when it comes to easy growth marketing, but CRO or <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/conversion-rate-optimization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Conversion Rate Optimisation </a>is an infinitely complex area. To make things easy all you need to do is to start tracking conversions on a platform like Google Analytics.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">When you have started to track conversions you will then be able to see where they are coming from and how people are reaching you. The most important thing to do is to take insights from what you see and formulate various hypotheses of how you could improve your marketing.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Once you are comfortable doing this, you can then move on to look at the pages that contribute to each conversion and optimise the customer experience. There are a lot of different ways to do this, with multivariant and A/B testing, but find the one that works best for you and your business and go from there.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Sophisticated tracking software might be overkill in the early stages of CRO, and may even harm the load speed of your website. To make things easy, test in a limited way to incrementally improve your conversion rate and use a tool like <a href=\"https://optimize.google.com/optimize/home/#/accounts\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Optimize</a> (free from Google).</p> <h3>6. Start to plan what you want to test.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Testing is an essential part of easy growth marketing, but before you can start testing, you need to have a <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" >plan</a>. Figure out what is going to have the biggest impact on your business and then create a plan for how you're going to do it.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">It is important at this stage that you test your assumptions rather than committing to the plan as it stands. Work out the major assumptions that have been made and then find a way to test if they are true, one by one. I guarantee that your plan will change drastically in light of the results you get.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: To make things easier, try not to commit early on to the specifics of a plan, rather, instead have a general direction of travel, and also focus on satisfying customer needs that you can demonstrate through evidence. Finally, make sure every experiment or campaign you undertake can be measured in some way.</p> <h3>7. Focus on the whole customer journey, not just awareness and acquisition.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">An easy way to get a competitive advantage over other companies in your space is to consider the whole of your customer journey. A lot of businesses focus on the top of the funnel, but if you want to grow your business, you need to focus on the entire customer journey.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">This includes everything from awareness, trail, conversion, upsell, and advocacy. Work out what marketing and channels you are using in each of these areas and then decide where you need to place your efforts.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">This is a complex area, and if you are struggling, we do have a service designed exactly to help you make the most of your <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">customer journey mapping</a>. Please drop us a line to find out more. This easy growth marketing technique is often overlooked.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Ask yourself; If we only work on one thing in the next 6 months what would it be? Are there areas where we don't spend any time or focus? What would be the impact on the business if we did? Should we stop undertaking activity in certain areas?</p> <h3>8. Make sure your website is fit for purpose.</h3> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Your website is often the first interaction someone has with your business, so it's important to make sure it's up to par. This means having a well-designed website that is easy to navigate and provides value to your visitors. Also making sure that is visible to search engines and will rank well in the future is critical to easy growth marketing success.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">You will need to consider whether the platform and technology you have chosen will be able to scale over time and whether you will be able to bear the additional costs in your business model. Also, think about how different users will interact with your website do potential customers have as good an experience as logged-in users or paying customers. Quite often if the answer is no, you have a highly evolved product, but a weak marketing function.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">In some extreme cases, it may be easier to ditch your existing website and develop a new one that will scale as your business does. However, in most cases making small website improvements is an easy growth marketing win.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: Consider undertaking a <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-audit/technical/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical SEO audit</a>, as well as performing some <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">user testing</a>. In both cases, the additional costs will be more than overweighed by the performance and user experience benefits on your bottom line.</p> <h2 id=\"measure\">Measure success</h2> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Once you've launched your easy growth marketing experiments, it's important to take some time to measure their success or lack thereof. There are many different metrics you could choose to measure, including website traffic, conversion rate, and social media engagement.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">You will need to have a dedicated place to note down these results as well as any insights that were gleaned from the activity. This could be simple and easy as a <a href=\"https://assets.strategyzer.com/assets/resources/the-learning-card.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">learnings card</a>, or a dedicated strategy canvas where results are recorded and analysed.</p> <figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"399\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image.jpeg 399w, https://polything.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/image-214x300.jpeg 214w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" /></figure> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Finally, you'll want to track how the results vary over time, this will give you the warnings and wins so that you can make adjustments as needed.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Tip: An easy growth marketing method of measuring results is just to have a Google Sheet with every experiment and campaign, together with the key metrics that you want to measure.</p> <h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">Growth marketing is an incredibly effective way to reach new customers and grow your business. It's also a great way to build brand awareness and loyalty and to get more people talking about your company. Finally, it can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional marketing.</p> <p id=\"d3d94cf9-019f-47c2-ae49-91b326a489cf\">As the world of marketing continues to evolve, growth marketing will likely become even more popular.

And what does it actually mean?</h2> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p id=\"dd3ac1ff-6991-4436-9aef-bbb53938783f\">Growth marketing is a term that is used a lot in the marketing world, but what does it actually mean?</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">At its simplest, growth marketing is all about driving growth for a business through marketing activities. This can be done through acquisition, conversion or retention activities, or a combination of all three.</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">It is not a new concept, but it has gained a lot of traction in recent years as businesses have become more focused on growth and scale.</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\"><strong>Polything</strong> partners with companies that want to use the power of <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">growth marketing</a> and storytelling to elevate their businesses. We believe in a strategic approach to growth marketing that focuses on sustainable, long-term results.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"#basics\">The basics of growth marketing</a></li><li><a href=\"#hacking\" >The difference between growth hacking and growth marketing</a></li><li><a href=\"#grow\" >How it can help your business grow</a></li><li><a href=\"#tips\" >Tips for implementing growth marketing in your own business</a></li><li><a href=\"#resources\" >Resources to learn more about growth marketing</a></li><li><a href=\"#conclusion\" >Conclusion</a></li></ul> <h2 id=\"basics\">The basics of growth marketing</h2> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">There are several different approaches, but at its core, it is about making data-driven decisions and continuously optimizing your marketing efforts. One of the most important things to remember is that it should be constantly evolving. As your business changes, so too should your strategy. <a href=\"https://polything.co.uk/approach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Growth marketing</a> is not a one-time event or campaign, but rather it should be an ongoing process that is constantly adapted to the changing needs of your business.</p> <h2>The difference between growth hacking and growth marketing</h2> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Growth hacking and growth marketing are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two terms.</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Growth hacking is a more technical approach to growth marketing and it tends to focus on using creative and innovative methods to grow a business. Growth hacking is often associated with start-ups, as it is a relatively new concept.</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Growth marketing, on the other hand, is a more strategic approach to growth. It takes into account all aspects of the marketing mix, and it focuses on making sustainable, long-term improvements to your business performance.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"grow\">How it can help your business grow</h2> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">There are many different ways in which growth marketing can help your business grow. Some of the most common strategies include:</p> <p id=\"8357df19-0bd8-4e91-ac62-f2aa592dfa57\"><strong>Acquisition:</strong> Acquisition strategies are all about attracting new customers or users to your business. This can be done through various marketing channels such as paid advertising, organic search, social media, email marketing and more. It also involves understanding the merits of each of these channels and how they contribute to changing a cold prospect into a customer.</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\"><strong>Conversion: </strong>Once you have acquired new users or customers, the next step is to convert them into paying customers. This can be done through effective lead nurturing and conversion optimisation tactics. It may also involve conversion rate optimisation depending on how your customer journey has been constructed. Better conversions will reduce your CPA and extend your LTV.</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\"><strong>Retention:</strong> The next step is to keep your customers happy and engaged so they continue to do business with you.

Plan and execute campaigns in a timely fashion</h3> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Marketing campaigns need to be planned and executed in a timely fashion in order to be effective. If you wait too long, the campaign may be irrelevant by the time it&#8217;s launched. Only by undertaking an activity will your get hard evidence and hard results are the key ingredients to base learnings on. Done is better than perfect!</p> <h3>2. Have a systematic plan of what you need to test and what you want to learn</h3> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Your campaigns need to be targeted and relevant to your audience to be effective. This means doing your research and understanding who your target market is. Once you know this, you can create campaigns that are designed to reach them.</p> <h3>3. Always be learning and constantly iterating</h3> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">The process is cyclical and never done. You should always be learning from your campaigns and constantly iterating to improve your results. This means testing new things, trying new tactics, and generally being open to change. It is an ongoing process and a mindset, not a one-time event.</p> <h3>4. Be prepared to invest</h3> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Growth marketing requires time, effort and sometimes money. To be successful, you need to be prepared to invest in it. This could mean engaging a growth marketer or agency, investing in marketing software, or simply spending more time on marketing activities. Set an overall budget and give someone the responsibility of spending it. Gauge this against your existing cost of acquiring a customer and extrapolate the two to give them a target of new customers to go and acquire.</p> <h3>5. Use a variety of channels</h3> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Don&#8217;t just rely on one channel, use a variety of them. This will ensure that your message is reaching a wider audience and that you&#8217;re not putting all your eggs in one basket. Interview your existing customers to see how they use and engage with different channels to formulate a hypothesis of the best mix.</p> <h3>6. Measure, track, and analyse your results</h3> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">Always, always measure, and analyse your results so you can see what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. This will help you to refine and adjust your strategy over time. So many companies fail at this level and do not benchmark new activity against previous campaigns or programmes.</p> <p id=\"a313d84a-a4c1-4674-802f-0f2d17fc9aba\">By following these tips, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to successfully implementing growth marketing in your own business.
