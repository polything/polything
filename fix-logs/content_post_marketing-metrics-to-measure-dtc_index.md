These metrics help you to understand whether your marketing team is working efficiently and effectively.</p> <p id="ca8ac448-d0d5-4adc-876a-a358e0c5a937">Some examples of operational marketing metrics include:</p> <ul> <li>Number of leads generated</li> <li>Number of website visitors</li> <li>Number of social media followers</li> <li>Number of email subscribers</li> <li>Number of marketing collateral pieces produced</li> </ul> <h3>Performance marketing metric</h3> <p id="242e6dc3-daf0-4e0e-9a8c-c42070516e7f">Performance marketing metrics, on the other hand, are used to track the success of your marketing campaigns. These metrics help you to understand whether your marketing campaigns are achieving their objectives. Also whether they are providing a positive return on investment (ROI).</p> <p id="7a8c8661-fd15-4d2a-a757-96a41b4f84a5">Metrics are also usually split into two different types of indicators:</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061"><strong>Leading indicators</strong> are measures that predict future performance. They show whether your marketing activities are likely to result in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061">Some common leading indicators include; website traffic, social media engagement, and email list growth.</p> <p id="b30e8815-7c30-4aca-adfe-2f39971c7ea7"><strong>Lagging indicators</strong> are measures that reflect past performance. They show if your marketing activities have resulted in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d2e2e8fc-6909-42aa-9dd2-e492afffb5b6">Common lagging indicators include sales revenue, conversion rate, and customer lifetime value.</p> <h2>How to measure marketing metrics for your business</h2> <p id="b72f1027-a866-4462-8c4c-4177d56682d0">Before measuring marketing metrics, you first need to identify your goals. What are you trying to achieve with your marketing activities? Once you know your goals, you can identify the appropriate metrics to measure.</p> <p id="625d176c-7d60-4b1b-8404-1732df490a5e">For example, if your goal is to increase brand awareness, you could measure metrics such as website traffic, social media reach, and email list growth. Or, if your goal is to increase sales, you could measure metrics such as conversion rate, average order value, and customer lifetime value.</p> <p id="5db2d73b-dbef-4bf9-9e5c-3a3d8250a511">Once you know which metrics to measure, you need to decide how you will collect the data. There are many tools available to help you track marketing metrics, such as; <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Data Studio</a>, and <a href="https://business.adobe.com/uk/what-is-experience-cloud.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Cloud</a>.</p> <h2>Key marketing metrics to measure for your DTC marketing</h2> <p id="838ced80-0163-4720-b3a1-32cb02c82a32">There is a multitude of marketing metrics to measure for your DTC business, but we have distilled down the key metrics that we recommend you track for your business:</p> <ul> <li>Conversion Rate</li> <li>Average Order Value (AOV)</li> <li>Customer Acquisition Cost per Channel (CAC)</li> <li>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)</li> <li>Churn Rate</li> <li>Net Promoter Score</li> </ul> <h3>Conversion Rate (CR)</h3> <p id="a136af1e-d23a-46b1-b5fc-be1070c1f31c">How many prospects are converting to paying customers expressed as a percentage. This is a useful metric to understand whether you are reaching the right type of users. Also how efficiently your app or website is at converting warm prospects. A low conversion rate would indicate a problem with your channels, targeting, and messaging. Or possibly an issue with your landing pages, product pages, and checkout process.</p> <style> .conversion-calculator { max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .conversion-calculator input { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 5px; } .conversion-calculator button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: #0073aa; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 3px; cursor: pointer; } .conversion-calculator #result { margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold; } </style> <div class="conversion-calculator"> <h3>Conversion Rate Calculator</h3> <input type="number" id="conversions" placeholder="Number of Conversions"> <input type="number" id="visitors" placeholder="Total Number of Visitors"> <button onclick="calculateConversionRate()">Calculate Conversion Rate</button> <div id="result"></div> </div> <script> function calculateConversionRate() { const conversions = parseFloat(document.getElementById('conversions').value); const visitors = parseFloat(document.getElementById('visitors').value); if (isNaN(conversions) || isNaN(visitors)) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Please enter valid numbers for all fields."; return; } if (visitors === 0) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Number of visitors cannot be zero."; return; } const conversionRate = (conversions / visitors) * 100; document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Conversion Rate: ${conversionRate.toFixed(2)}%`; } </script> <h3>Average Order Value (AOV)</h3> <p id="d4bbb966-34f9-4a32-be33-85d4361fbdf6">The average amount of money each paying customer spends.

This is a key metric to monitor as it will help you to understand the efficiency of your marketing mix. If your CAC is too high, it can be an indication that you need to revisit your <a href="https://polything.co.uk/approach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketing strategy</a> or allocate your resources more efficiently.</p> <style> .cac-calculator { max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .cac-calculator input { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 5px; } .cac-calculator button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: #0073aa; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 3px; cursor: pointer; } .cac-calculator #result { margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold; } </style> <div class="cac-calculator"> <h3>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Calculator</h3> <input type="number" id="totalCost" placeholder="Total Marketing and Sales Costs"> <input type="number" id="newCustomers" placeholder="Number of New Customers Acquired"> <button onclick="calculateCAC()">Calculate CAC</button> <div id="result"></div> </div> <script> function calculateCAC() { const totalCost = parseFloat(document.getElementById('totalCost').value); const newCustomers = parseFloat(document.getElementById('newCustomers').value); if (isNaN(totalCost) || isNaN(newCustomers)) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Please enter valid numbers for all fields."; return; } if (newCustomers === 0) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Number of new customers cannot be zero."; return; } const cac = totalCost / newCustomers; document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Customer Acquisition Cost: $${cac.toFixed(2)}`; } </script> <h3>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)</h3> <p id="f2e5028d-09b2-4af9-847c-b5c6848964aa">The average amount of money a customer spends with your company over their lifetime. This is a critical metric to monitor as it will help you to understand the profitability of your customer base. Also, it helps you understand how much you can afford to spend to acquire a new customer. If your LTV is too low, it can be an indication that you need to work on your product offering or pricing strategy. </p> <style> .ltv-calculator { max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .ltv-calculator input { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 5px; } .ltv-calculator button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: #0073aa; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 3px; cursor: pointer; } .ltv-calculator #result { margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold; } </style> <div class="ltv-calculator"> <h3>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculator</h3> <input type="number" id="avgPurchaseValue" placeholder="Average Purchase Value"> <input type="number" id="avgPurchaseFrequency" placeholder="Average Purchase Frequency (per year)"> <input type="number" id="avgCustomerLifespan" placeholder="Average Customer Lifespan (in years)"> <button onclick="calculateLTV()">Calculate LTV</button> <div id="result"></div> </div> <script> function calculateLTV() { const avgPurchaseValue = parseFloat(document.getElementById('avgPurchaseValue').value); const avgPurchaseFrequency = parseFloat(document.getElementById('avgPurchaseFrequency').value); const avgCustomerLifespan = parseFloat(document.getElementById('avgCustomerLifespan').value); if (isNaN(avgPurchaseValue) || isNaN(avgPurchaseFrequency) || isNaN(avgCustomerLifespan)) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Please enter valid numbers for all fields."; return; } const ltv = avgPurchaseValue * avgPurchaseFrequency * avgCustomerLifespan; document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Customer Lifetime Value: $${ltv.toFixed(2)}`; } </script> <h3>Churn Rate</h3> <p id="6cb70e38-6249-4d3f-81af-85006304d7c2">The percentage of customers who stop using your product or service within a given period, usually monthly.

Also whether your <a href="https://polything.co.uk/services/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">marketing programme</a> is having a positive impact on consumers.</p> <p id="78631ecd-5608-4255-ae41-314049f1f15b">If your NPS score is too low, it can be an indication that you need to work on your customer service or that you are marketing too much in some areas.</p> <p id="21f3cd6d-861f-4f1d-9ee6-593d22c6bb28">There are many other marketing metrics to measure, but these are the most important metrics that we believe will help you to understand the effectiveness of your DTC marketing.

These metrics help you to understand whether your marketing team is working efficiently and effectively.</p> <p id="ca8ac448-d0d5-4adc-876a-a358e0c5a937">Some examples of operational marketing metrics include:</p> <ul> <li>Number of leads generated</li> <li>Number of website visitors</li> <li>Number of social media followers</li> <li>Number of email subscribers</li> <li>Number of marketing collateral pieces produced</li> </ul> <h3>Performance marketing metric</h3> <p id="242e6dc3-daf0-4e0e-9a8c-c42070516e7f">Performance marketing metrics, on the other hand, are used to track the success of your marketing campaigns. These metrics help you to understand whether your marketing campaigns are achieving their objectives. Also whether they are providing a positive return on investment (ROI).</p> <p id="7a8c8661-fd15-4d2a-a757-96a41b4f84a5">Metrics are also usually split into two different types of indicators:</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061"><strong>Leading indicators</strong> are measures that predict future performance. They show whether your marketing activities are likely to result in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061">Some common leading indicators include; website traffic, social media engagement, and email list growth.</p> <p id="b30e8815-7c30-4aca-adfe-2f39971c7ea7"><strong>Lagging indicators</strong> are measures that reflect past performance. They show if your marketing activities have resulted in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d2e2e8fc-6909-42aa-9dd2-e492afffb5b6">Common lagging indicators include sales revenue, conversion rate, and customer lifetime value.</p> <h2>How to measure marketing metrics for your business</h2> <p id="b72f1027-a866-4462-8c4c-4177d56682d0">Before measuring marketing metrics, you first need to identify your goals. What are you trying to achieve with your marketing activities? Once you know your goals, you can identify the appropriate metrics to measure.</p> <p id="625d176c-7d60-4b1b-8404-1732df490a5e">For example, if your goal is to increase brand awareness, you could measure metrics such as website traffic, social media reach, and email list growth. Or, if your goal is to increase sales, you could measure metrics such as conversion rate, average order value, and customer lifetime value.</p> <p id="5db2d73b-dbef-4bf9-9e5c-3a3d8250a511">Once you know which metrics to measure, you need to decide how you will collect the data. There are many tools available to help you track marketing metrics, such as; <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Data Studio</a>, and <a href="https://business.adobe.com/uk/what-is-experience-cloud.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Cloud</a>.</p> <h2>Key marketing metrics to measure for your DTC marketing</h2> <p id="838ced80-0163-4720-b3a1-32cb02c82a32">There is a multitude of marketing metrics to measure for your DTC business, but we have distilled down the key metrics that we recommend you track for your business:</p> <ul> <li>Conversion Rate</li> <li>Average Order Value (AOV)</li> <li>Customer Acquisition Cost per Channel (CAC)</li> <li>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)</li> <li>Churn Rate</li> <li>Net Promoter Score</li> </ul> <h3>Conversion Rate (CR)</h3> <p id="a136af1e-d23a-46b1-b5fc-be1070c1f31c">How many prospects are converting to paying customers expressed as a percentage. This is a useful metric to understand whether you are reaching the right type of users. Also how efficiently your app or website is at converting warm prospects. A low conversion rate would indicate a problem with your channels, targeting, and messaging. Or possibly an issue with your landing pages, product pages, and checkout process.</p> <style> .conversion-calculator { max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .conversion-calculator input { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 5px; } .conversion-calculator button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: #0073aa; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 3px; cursor: pointer; } .conversion-calculator #result { margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold; } </style> <div class="conversion-calculator"> <h3>Conversion Rate Calculator</h3> <input type="number" id="conversions" placeholder="Number of Conversions"> <input type="number" id="visitors" placeholder="Total Number of Visitors"> <button onclick="calculateConversionRate()">Calculate Conversion Rate</button> <div id="result"></div> </div> <script> function calculateConversionRate() { const conversions = parseFloat(document.getElementById('conversions').value); const visitors = parseFloat(document.getElementById('visitors').value); if (isNaN(conversions) || isNaN(visitors)) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Please enter valid numbers for all fields."; return; } if (visitors === 0) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Number of visitors cannot be zero."; return; } const conversionRate = (conversions / visitors) * 100; document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Conversion Rate: ${conversionRate.toFixed(2)}%`; } </script> <h3>Average Order Value (AOV)</h3> <p id="d4bbb966-34f9-4a32-be33-85d4361fbdf6">The average amount of money each paying customer spends.

This is a key metric to monitor as it will help you to understand the efficiency of your marketing mix.

This is a critical metric to monitor as it will help you to understand the profitability of your customer base. Also, it helps you understand how much you can afford to spend to acquire a new customer. If your LTV is too low, it can be an indication that you need to work on your product offering or pricing strategy. </p> <style> .ltv-calculator { max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .ltv-calculator input { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 5px; } .ltv-calculator button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: #0073aa; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 3px; cursor: pointer; } .ltv-calculator #result { margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold; } </style> <div class="ltv-calculator"> <h3>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculator</h3> <input type="number" id="avgPurchaseValue" placeholder="Average Purchase Value"> <input type="number" id="avgPurchaseFrequency" placeholder="Average Purchase Frequency (per year)"> <input type="number" id="avgCustomerLifespan" placeholder="Average Customer Lifespan (in years)"> <button onclick="calculateLTV()">Calculate LTV</button> <div id="result"></div> </div> <script> function calculateLTV() { const avgPurchaseValue = parseFloat(document.getElementById('avgPurchaseValue').value); const avgPurchaseFrequency = parseFloat(document.getElementById('avgPurchaseFrequency').value); const avgCustomerLifespan = parseFloat(document.getElementById('avgCustomerLifespan').value); if (isNaN(avgPurchaseValue) || isNaN(avgPurchaseFrequency) || isNaN(avgCustomerLifespan)) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Please enter valid numbers for all fields."; return; } const ltv = avgPurchaseValue * avgPurchaseFrequency * avgCustomerLifespan; document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Customer Lifetime Value: $${ltv.toFixed(2)}`; } </script> <h3>Churn Rate</h3> <p id="6cb70e38-6249-4d3f-81af-85006304d7c2">The percentage of customers who stop using your product or service within a given period, usually monthly.

Also whether your <a href="https://polything.co.uk/services/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">marketing programme</a> is having a positive impact on consumers.</p> <p id="78631ecd-5608-4255-ae41-314049f1f15b">If your NPS score is too low, it can be an indication that you need to work on your customer service or that you are marketing too much in some areas.</p> <p id="21f3cd6d-861f-4f1d-9ee6-593d22c6bb28">There are many other marketing metrics to measure, but these are the most important metrics that we believe will help you to understand the effectiveness of your DTC marketing.

These metrics help you to understand whether your marketing team is working efficiently and effectively.</p> <p id="ca8ac448-d0d5-4adc-876a-a358e0c5a937">Some examples of operational marketing metrics include:</p> <ul> <li>Number of leads generated</li> <li>Number of website visitors</li> <li>Number of social media followers</li> <li>Number of email subscribers</li> <li>Number of marketing collateral pieces produced</li> </ul> <h3>Performance marketing metric</h3> <p id="242e6dc3-daf0-4e0e-9a8c-c42070516e7f">Performance marketing metrics, on the other hand, are used to track the success of your marketing campaigns. These metrics help you to understand whether your marketing campaigns are achieving their objectives. Also whether they are providing a positive return on investment (ROI).</p> <p id="7a8c8661-fd15-4d2a-a757-96a41b4f84a5">Metrics are also usually split into two different types of indicators:</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061"><strong>Leading indicators</strong> are measures that predict future performance. They show whether your marketing activities are likely to result in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061">Some common leading indicators include; website traffic, social media engagement, and email list growth.</p> <p id="b30e8815-7c30-4aca-adfe-2f39971c7ea7"><strong>Lagging indicators</strong> are measures that reflect past performance. They show if your marketing activities have resulted in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d2e2e8fc-6909-42aa-9dd2-e492afffb5b6">Common lagging indicators include sales revenue, conversion rate, and customer lifetime value.</p> <h2>How to measure marketing metrics for your business</h2> <p id="b72f1027-a866-4462-8c4c-4177d56682d0">Before measuring marketing metrics, you first need to identify your goals. What are you trying to achieve with your marketing activities? Once you know your goals, you can identify the appropriate metrics to measure.</p> <p id="625d176c-7d60-4b1b-8404-1732df490a5e">For example, if your goal is to increase brand awareness, you could measure metrics such as website traffic, social media reach, and email list growth. Or, if your goal is to increase sales, you could measure metrics such as conversion rate, average order value, and customer lifetime value.</p> <p id="5db2d73b-dbef-4bf9-9e5c-3a3d8250a511">Once you know which metrics to measure, you need to decide how you will collect the data. There are many tools available to help you track marketing metrics, such as; <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Data Studio</a>, and <a href="https://business.adobe.com/uk/what-is-experience-cloud.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Cloud</a>.</p> <h2>Key marketing metrics to measure for your DTC marketing</h2> <p id="838ced80-0163-4720-b3a1-32cb02c82a32">There is a multitude of marketing metrics to measure for your DTC business, but we have distilled down the key metrics that we recommend you track for your business:</p> <ul> <li>Conversion Rate</li> <li>Average Order Value (AOV)</li> <li>Customer Acquisition Cost per Channel (CAC)</li> <li>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)</li> <li>Churn Rate</li> <li>Net Promoter Score</li> </ul> <h3>Conversion Rate (CR)</h3> <p id="a136af1e-d23a-46b1-b5fc-be1070c1f31c">How many prospects are converting to paying customers expressed as a percentage. This is a useful metric to understand whether you are reaching the right type of users. Also how efficiently your app or website is at converting warm prospects. A low conversion rate would indicate a problem with your channels, targeting, and messaging. Or possibly an issue with your landing pages, product pages, and checkout process.</p> <style> .conversion-calculator { max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .conversion-calculator input { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 5px; } .conversion-calculator button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: #0073aa; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 3px; cursor: pointer; } .conversion-calculator #result { margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold; } </style> <div class="conversion-calculator"> <h3>Conversion Rate Calculator</h3> <input type="number" id="conversions" placeholder="Number of Conversions"> <input type="number" id="visitors" placeholder="Total Number of Visitors"> <button onclick="calculateConversionRate()">Calculate Conversion Rate</button> <div id="result"></div> </div> <script> function calculateConversionRate() { const conversions = parseFloat(document.getElementById('conversions').value); const visitors = parseFloat(document.getElementById('visitors').value); if (isNaN(conversions) || isNaN(visitors)) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Please enter valid numbers for all fields."; return; } if (visitors === 0) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Number of visitors cannot be zero."; return; } const conversionRate = (conversions / visitors) * 100; document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Conversion Rate: ${conversionRate.toFixed(2)}%`; } </script> <h3>Average Order Value (AOV)</h3> <p id="d4bbb966-34f9-4a32-be33-85d4361fbdf6">The average amount of money each paying customer spends.

This is a critical metric to monitor as it will help you to understand the profitability of your customer base.

Also whether they are providing a positive return on investment (ROI).</p> <p id="7a8c8661-fd15-4d2a-a757-96a41b4f84a5">Metrics are also usually split into two different types of indicators:</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061"><strong>Leading indicators</strong> are measures that predict future performance. They show whether your marketing activities are likely to result in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d1e8bd52-c3a0-409d-93ff-fb59b90db061">Some common leading indicators include; website traffic, social media engagement, and email list growth.</p> <p id="b30e8815-7c30-4aca-adfe-2f39971c7ea7"><strong>Lagging indicators</strong> are measures that reflect past performance. They show if your marketing activities have resulted in sales or other desired outcomes.</p> <p id="d2e2e8fc-6909-42aa-9dd2-e492afffb5b6">Common lagging indicators include sales revenue, conversion rate, and customer lifetime value.</p> <h2>How to measure marketing metrics for your business</h2> <p id="b72f1027-a866-4462-8c4c-4177d56682d0">Before measuring marketing metrics, you first need to identify your goals. What are you trying to achieve with your marketing activities? Once you know your goals, you can identify the appropriate metrics to measure.</p> <p id="625d176c-7d60-4b1b-8404-1732df490a5e">For example, if your goal is to increase brand awareness, you could measure metrics such as website traffic, social media reach, and email list growth. Or, if your goal is to increase sales, you could measure metrics such as conversion rate, average order value, and customer lifetime value.</p> <p id="5db2d73b-dbef-4bf9-9e5c-3a3d8250a511">Once you know which metrics to measure, you need to decide how you will collect the data. There are many tools available to help you track marketing metrics, such as; <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a>, <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google Data Studio</a>, and <a href="https://business.adobe.com/uk/what-is-experience-cloud.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Adobe Experience Cloud</a>.</p> <h2>Key marketing metrics to measure for your DTC marketing</h2> <p id="838ced80-0163-4720-b3a1-32cb02c82a32">There is a multitude of marketing metrics to measure for your DTC business, but we have distilled down the key metrics that we recommend you track for your business:</p> <ul> <li>Conversion Rate</li> <li>Average Order Value (AOV)</li> <li>Customer Acquisition Cost per Channel (CAC)</li> <li>Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)</li> <li>Churn Rate</li> <li>Net Promoter Score</li> </ul> <h3>Conversion Rate (CR)</h3> <p id="a136af1e-d23a-46b1-b5fc-be1070c1f31c">How many prospects are converting to paying customers expressed as a percentage. This is a useful metric to understand whether you are reaching the right type of users. Also how efficiently your app or website is at converting warm prospects. A low conversion rate would indicate a problem with your channels, targeting, and messaging. Or possibly an issue with your landing pages, product pages, and checkout process.</p> <style> .conversion-calculator { max-width: 400px; margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .conversion-calculator input { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 5px; } .conversion-calculator button { width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: #0073aa; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 3px; cursor: pointer; } .conversion-calculator #result { margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold; } </style> <div class="conversion-calculator"> <h3>Conversion Rate Calculator</h3> <input type="number" id="conversions" placeholder="Number of Conversions"> <input type="number" id="visitors" placeholder="Total Number of Visitors"> <button onclick="calculateConversionRate()">Calculate Conversion Rate</button> <div id="result"></div> </div> <script> function calculateConversionRate() { const conversions = parseFloat(document.getElementById('conversions').value); const visitors = parseFloat(document.getElementById('visitors').value); if (isNaN(conversions) || isNaN(visitors)) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Please enter valid numbers for all fields."; return; } if (visitors === 0) { document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "Number of visitors cannot be zero."; return; } const conversionRate = (conversions / visitors) * 100; document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Conversion Rate: ${conversionRate.toFixed(2)}%`; } </script> <h3>Average Order Value (AOV)</h3> <p id="d4bbb966-34f9-4a32-be33-85d4361fbdf6">The average amount of money each paying customer spends.
